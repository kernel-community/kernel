# The KERNEL Learning Modules

## ✨ Transformation, not information

The core learning objectives (CLOs) of the **KERNEL Learn Track** are defined broadly, because building a better web requires more than technical knowledge. 

The objective of our syllabus is to start with wisdom, and work backwards. We'll build *long-term thinking skills*, provide *context and technical history*, and introduce you to the *patterns* and *modes* required to flourish in decentralized, open communities like Web 3.

The Build Track is designed to teach *practical skills* that builders like you need for your projects. The Learn Track aims to provide a more holistic framing on what Web 3 is — its principles, history, and present state.  

The glue which binds these two tracks together is the **people** in your cohort. By connecting you with the best minds we know to teach you practical thinking skills, combined with effective patterns for using innovative tools and creating decentralized solutions, we aim to help you become one of the **people** building a new way of living, day by digital day.
