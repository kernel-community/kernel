# ⚖️ Scaling Principled Games

This week we'll try to keep it simple. It's easy to lose your bearings when describing a planetary-scale, decentralized, [networked virtual machine](../module-1/) which provides a shared, ownerless computing surface on which we can run the [global financial system](../module-2/); [reimagine the web](../module-3) and our [organisational customs](../module-4); alter the [incentives which power society](../module-5) and ultimately create the interpersonal [trust](../module-0/trust) required to [play](../module-0/play-of-pattern) principled, infinite games with each other.

Last week we asked you what constitutes [persuasion](../module-5/incentives/#persuasion) and argued that it is language which performs what it says. We've highlighted how economic code which distributes [value](../module-1/value/) by virtue of how it is expressed constitutes a [new class of performative speech acts](../module-4/self-enquiry/#identity-we-can-live-with) of a most [meaningful](../module-1/meaning/) kind. Hopefully, you're beginning to see how this course is itself a kind of chain: each module [linked](../module-3/lock-it-open/#the-path-forward) in ever greater detail to the [ones before](../module-3/time/); each piece within each week [indebted](../../module-2/debt/) to [many others](../module-4/the-garden) which [transform it](../module-3/remember/) from something which stands alone into part of a bigger, [digital](../module-4/art/) [picture](../module-0/purpose/).

## Week 6

This week is an opportunity for [reflection](../module-3/humility/). KERNEL is built around "ever-green" content and so, while there is a great deal of information about scaling and staking [available](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news), we'll only cover the Eth2 Design Rationale and the [promised Bret Victor video from Week 1](../module-1/joyful-subversion/#experiment-with-format).

Take your time, enjoy the serene pace, and let's co-create some beautifully principled games to play with one another.
