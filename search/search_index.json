Koans come from the zen tradition. They are seemingly simple questions which, at first blush, make no sense. \"What is the sound of one hand clapping?\" or \"When the tree withers and the leaves fall, then what?\" Koans are a type of lens aimed at short-circuiting our map-making habits so that we may arrive at a fuller experience of reality. If opened within, koans can reveal what is by asking over and over questions we cannot answer except with our whole being. Thus we arrive at the Genjo Koan : your own life, for that which is manifesting before your eyes right now is absolute reality. Ikkyu, our friend from module four , sums up all this nonsense masterfully: Only one koan matters You The Universal Library Koans are a means by which the master is able to learn whether the student has figured out who the teacher really is. Can you see yet - and are you living - the total lack of difference between lehren and lernen ? Either way, we need a similarly creative means of examining the breadth and depth of Kernel peers' conscious experience of their world, without being able to sit and breathe together in person. Without the age-old meaningful meeting between which might open the door for both into this single empty form, where can we find such a means? The only way is through [the universal library] . Every word you could possibly write is already in there: the bitcoin whitepaper , the bible , the Kernel syllabus , the true story of your own death, the Universal Declaration of Peace, every poem, every love song, every sick note you ever handed in to try and skip school because they never taught you how to truly learn... Literally everything that could ever be strung together is already there. The problem, of course, is finding the right signal in such an infinite array of noise. Docere et delectare : to teach and delight. That is our goal. And, strange though it seems, all the best, most creative, insightful, and delightful means of doing so are already in the Library. Yet we still have to write them out so that you can solve them... Week 0 - Changing the Conversation We'll start simply. Anyone who is able to solve our series of riddles - based on the content from week 0 - will become the steward of this one-of-a-kind NFT , which blends the I Ching hexagrams with a circular representation of our genetic code.

Each module is made up of two sections: Crafted Reading , which we will expect you to have read before the beginning of each new week; and Curated Material which is made up of articles, videos, and the occasional podcast that we highly recommend you go over before the Fireside Chat each week. Structure Crafted Reading is made up of 2 separate lessons: a \"personal\" lesson designed to teach you one of the principles we believe are important for your own navigation of this new and wild web; and a \"web 3\" lesson which is more technical and goes to the heart of critical concepts which we often don't reflect upon enough, like \"Trust\", \"Value\" and \"Freedom\". The Crafted Reading is specifically not long and hopefully not boring. It should take you a maximum of 5 minutes to read each piece, so we only expect 10 minutes of reading before the beginning of each week. The ideas each piece presents are not \"the truth\" - they are intended to get you thinking so that you can come to your own unique conclusions about a wide range of critical topics. Curated Material is specifically not a long list of links no-one will ever have the time truly to reflect upon. We have picked 3-4 pieces for each week, in different formats (video, text, audio), and we have written detailed briefs for each piece. This is because we don't want to flood you with information; we want to teach you how to find the best information and then genuinely use it to transform your own skills, understanding and general approach to thinking about and building decentralized systems and tools. We highly recommend that you at least familiarise yourself with each brief. Timing Weeks begin on Tuesdays , because part of what we're doing here is breaking down our conditioned, culturally-acquired ways of thinking. What is more conditioning than the days of the week? Free yourself from Julian hegemony! \ud83d\ude09 Our Fireside Chat, which is when we'll bring in esteemed speakers from across the industry and introduce you to the most experienced and brilliant minds we know, will generally occur each Thursday. Fireside chats revolve specifically around the theme for that week. They will be fairly structured, and broadcast live on YouTube for you to watch, with a live chat to ask questions if there is time. As you'll see in this module, conversations are critical to KERNEL and the framework for learning which we're presenting here. Throughout the course of each week, we will also have a number of smaller conversations on a variety of themes. These conversations are hosted between you and other members of your cohort, because we learn best from our own peers. Cultured Conversation Meaningful conversation can only take place in a culture of respect and courtesy, between people who are capable of seeing their highest ideals in others and who can recognise and reflect the essential sameness which lies at the heart of each and every human being. We tend to only engage in conversations which we think we can \"take something away from\", be it new knowledge, an altered perspective, or an inside story we can leverage for our own gain. However, KERNEL conversations are about humility , presence and a genuine attentiveness towards others, not because you stand to benefit from them, but because cultivating these three capacities within yourself is its own reward, which may allow you to see clearly the complete and perfect sacred core of every person you encounter. What\u2019s perfectly whole seems flawed, but you can use it forever. What\u2019s perfectly full seems empty, but you can\u2019t use it up. True straightness looks crooked. Great skill looks clumsy.

How does this fit into KERNEL? There are many important takeaways here for the conversations we will be having in KERNEL and beyond. \"The quality of listening determines the quality of speaking.\" \"When people are listening, I'm compelled to speak more truth.\" We should aspire to positive sum, horizontal conversations (9:14 in the video). Horizontal conversations: interactive dialogue among peers. Participants share trust, living within the same context. Conversations continue and can be picked up tomorrow, or next week, or sometime later. Much more meaning is shared. \"I have a lot of respect for people who think as they speak, and who pause to think and to attach the meaning that matters .\" Vertical conversations: Each person speaks to get their point in \u2014 not building upon each other. It becomes a competition because you are thinking of what to say instead of listening. It doesn't allow one to hear, or to speak truthfully. Less meaning is shared. Asking better questions by listening more deeply What kinds of speech really carry value ? Brief \"We live in a world where it's become the fashion to just drop these cute one-liners at each other and think then that we know things. We ask questions without really wanting the answer - all we're seeking is a quick-fix; a conceptual solution to a curiosity that doesn't really matter because it's just a passing fancy. We don't live in a world where we have conversations about things that really matter! I mean endless explorations of the truth outside of ourselves...\" What is the truth outside yourself? How could you build open tools that encourage people to explore such ideas and connect in truly meaningful ways? \"We have a thousand alternatives for every fundamental, and we spend much of our lives preoccupied with those alternatives. Our lives therefore tend to be far more incidentally bound, rather than fundamentally related . In this we express our separation: from the natural world, from the fundamentals, from the cosmos.\" This is a profound linguistic play: we all find ourselves caught up in seemingly insignificant tasks which consistenly get in the way of that really profound thing you've been meaning to learn or do. Why is this? How can we move more of our daily existence into that which is not bound and imprisoned in trivialities, but rather fundamentally related to everything around us? Isn't that what a web does? \"I missed True Voice \". What is True Voice? Have you ever heard it? \"People listen. There are pauses between speaking which are filled with thinking, and with understanding.\" How comfortable are you with silence? Is this actually not the measure of companionship - how comfortable the silences are? \"Modern conversation doesn't give space for the words to settle in the listener [...] I have a lot of respect for people who think as they speak, and who pause to think and to attach the meaning that matters .\" How can you cultivate the space within yourself required to listen well? What does it really mean to attach conscious meaning to the words you say or write? How is this amplified when those words are executable code? \"One's speaking must be shaped by the quality of the listener. So, when you're listening to me I am compelled to speak more sense. I am compelled to speak more truth.

You either have water, or you do not have water. And in between is nothing.\" What are the fictional longings in your life? How could you get to their opposite to see how hollow fear and longing really are? Old Gifts Anew \"Modern humanity does not learn by being gifted. Our path is different.

Andreas was one of the first, and remains perhaps the most famous, presenter of Bitcoin and the ideas which inform it. Many of his talks and presentations have already become cultural artifacts. How does this fit into KERNEL? This talk provides an historical context for money and outlines why Bitcoin is important within that context. It has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Money and speech , and how closely interwoven these two have always been. Value in the broadest and most historical sense, with many pertinent examples provided. Meaning . This is not about money for the internet: it's about the internet of money. Brief Briefs present the most relevant quotes from the linked resource, with small pieces of added commentary where appropriate. \"If you think of money as technology, how old is this technology? [...] It's always surprising that people will say, 'Oh, 400 years old', '1000 years old', 'a few thousand years old'. In fact, we don't know how old money is [...] We have yet to discover a civilization that didn't have money. So, we know it's at least as old as civilization. One thing that really surprises people is that money is older than writing . The way we know this is that the first examples of writing [cuneiform and hieroglyphics] we have are writing about money - they're ledgers. Is writing older than the wheel? I don't know, but we do know that wheels were used as money. Money is an ancient technology .\" It's no small thing to talk about \"building better money\" because what we're actually talking about is a human symbolic construction which extends back beyond recorded history. Every time there has been a significant innovation in how money is expressed and/or used, very interesting things have happened to both the ways in which, and the scale at which, humans organize. \"Primates can be taught to use money: i.e. there are studies which show that you can teach them that specific stones can be exchanged for bananas. Very quickly, they invent both armed robbery and prostitution. What does this tell you about the nature of money? The important insight is that money is a form of communication . At its very basic level, money isn't value: money represents an abstraction of value. It's a way of communicating value . Money is a language .\" If money is a language, what does an innovation which makes its medium logically decentralized really mean? It may mean that no-one will control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no-one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use. What will you choose to say in this ancient language we are revitalizing? Once we add the ability to program this medium using a Turing-complete script, we may need to begin thinking of all this not in terms of a new language, but as a development of the order of language itself , but more on that later. \"Communicating value to each other is the basis of creating social bonds. Money is an important social tool .\" Money as linguistic technology is (and always has been) about the scale at which you can play your co-ordination game. The scale is now planetary. Are you ready to make your move? For the skeptics \"Think about how often the technology of money has been transformed. Very basically, communicating value can take place through an exchange of things of equal value. The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. Then nothing for a few thousand years. Then came the idea that I can deposit my gold with someone trustworthy; they can issue a paper certificate for my deposit; and I can trade that paper. With every technological revolution in money, there comes skepticism; and this is the moment of greatest skepticism in our history. The move to paper was highly controversial. It took about 400 years for paper as money to become broadly accepted. Then, 60 years ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards were paper, but then Diner's Club in the US created the first recognizable credit card (which was originally a form of a traveler's cheque). Now we have Bitcoin which represents a new form of 'doing money' and is as radical as the change from precious metals to paper, perhaps even more so. This is because our history as a species has to do with tangible expressions of wealth, and now we're dealing with a network-centric form of money which is totally abstract.\" We're really looking at a phase change in the expressive power of money: i.e. it can now be programmed to do stuff dynamically in addition to being traded. Why does it matter that we now have a network-centric form of programmable money which is totally abstract? Well, what money is, how it is created, and who gets to distribute it goes to the very heart of the ways in which we are all incentivised to act. Incentives can be thought of as the social, political and neurobiological primitives which define what kinds of behaviours we express - individually and collectively - and therefore the kinds of conscious experience we value, both personally and communally. Programming such primitives in a network-centric manner, where meaning is arrived at consensually, provides no less than the possibility to broaden the horizons of human consciousness. Open protocols and a network of value \"Bitcoin isn't just digital money (we already have that). Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation in the technology of money . So, let's talk about network architecture, because Bitcoin isn't happening in a vacuum; it's happening at a moment in history when we are seeing a transformation in many social institutions; i.e. the network-centric era. The internet has precipitated the change of many closed, hierarchical organizations and institutions into platforms . We've started seeing the introduction of interfaces - APIs - where information can flow in and out of the organization. Now, even more transformation is occurring with the change from platforms to protocols ; the difference being that, in protocols, there is no central appeal. TCP/IP doesn't work with reference to a service provider; TCP/IP works, without context , everywhere in the world. You don't have to sign up for an account, you just have to use the language . Once you go from a platform to a language, it creates a host of new possibilities. Bitcoin is the first, network-centric, protocol for money and what that means is that it exists without reference to an institution or platform. Once you've understood that money is a language used since time immemorial to communicate value, and that 2009 saw a phase shift from controlled, closed platforms to open, permissionless protocols; you've got the whole thing. What matters now is the precedents we set as the first users of these new protocols. \"'Peer-to-peer' money refers to an architecture which describes the relationship between participants in a (distributed) system. The architecture of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer because every participant in the network speaks the Bitcoin protocol at the same level . There are no \"special\" Bitcoin nodes. It means that every peer treats every transaction the same; it has no context in the peer's system apart from that which it gets from the network.\" Context and state are critical in distributed systems, because they are shared between all the peers who can therefore change that state according to certain rules, if they speak the agreed-upon language. This is very different to a client-server architecture like that run by Facebook, who retain total control over the state, as well as your data. Master-slave vs peer-to-peer \"Money is something that we don't talk about or teach, and perhaps this is a result of the architecture. Precious metals stored in a vault against which paper is issued mean that money in this expression is a form of debt, which curtails our discussions. How many of you have money in a bank? [everyone raises their hands] None of you have money in a bank! You have loaned your money to a bank: it is not the same thing.\" The bank-customer relationship is an earlier form of the same client-server architecture, and the money involved here only exists on a ledger that you do not have access to, or the ability to influence. \"Another term used for this client-server architecture where you maintain only a weak copy is a master-slave architecture. If you think about previous technologies of money as using this master-slave architecture, you have to ask an uncomfortable question: who is the slave?\" \"Bitcoin is totally different, because you don't owe anyone anything, nor does anyone owe you anything. It is not a system based on debt. It is a system based on absolute ownership of an abstract token. In Bitcoin, possession is 10/10ths of the law. Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation because it changes radically the architecture of money into one where every participant is equal and where a transaction has no state or context other than that required to obey the rules of a network no-one controls. Your money is yours; no-one can censor, sieze, or freeze it. No-one can tell you what to say with your money.\" The point about architecture is critical to understanding the deeper intentions of this KERNEL course: we want to teach you how to see the underlying patterns in things so that you can more efficiently process all the information coming at you and pick the most relevant bits, based on a firm grasp of the fundamentals, which will help you transform your knowledge and skills to those required to overhaul the web now that we have protocols for money. \"Rather than focussing on intrinsic value, we should be thinking about intrinsic utility . Bitcoin represents a moment of immense intrinsic utility: it is software-as-money, money-as-a-content-type, money-as-a-service. Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: it turns it into the internet of money . Later in the Q A session Andreas makes the point that \"Bitcoin is a choice; it's opt-in.\" So, the internet of money is not a given: it's what we're building now. It is our responsibility to make it transparent and eminently usable, while keeping it peer-to-peer, borderless, open, and fair. \"Interestingly enough, I think the blockchain will create a completely new kind of common good that we've never seen before. If you accept the idea that Bitcoin, or something like it, will continue to exist, we arrive at a place where - for the first time in history - we have a shared historical record which does not decay in time and cannot be changed: immutable history forever [...] This immutable history will itself become a common good with a scale in time that we have never had before, in any civilization (even those that carved their ledgers in stone).

[...] It's always surprising that people will say, 'Oh, 400 years old', '1000 years old', 'a few thousand years old'. In fact, we don't know how old money is [...] We have yet to discover a civilization that didn't have money. So, we know it's at least as old as civilization. One thing that really surprises people is that money is older than writing . The way we know this is that the first examples of writing [cuneiform and hieroglyphics] we have are writing about money - they're ledgers. Is writing older than the wheel? I don't know, but we do know that wheels were used as money. Money is an ancient technology .\" It's no small thing to talk about \"building better money\" because what we're actually talking about is a human symbolic construction which extends back beyond recorded history. Every time there has been a significant innovation in how money is expressed and/or used, very interesting things have happened to both the ways in which, and the scale at which, humans organize. \"Primates can be taught to use money: i.e. there are studies which show that you can teach them that specific stones can be exchanged for bananas. Very quickly, they invent both armed robbery and prostitution. What does this tell you about the nature of money? The important insight is that money is a form of communication . At its very basic level, money isn't value: money represents an abstraction of value. It's a way of communicating value . Money is a language .\" If money is a language, what does an innovation which makes its medium logically decentralized really mean? It may mean that no-one will control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no-one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use. What will you choose to say in this ancient language we are revitalizing? Once we add the ability to program this medium using a Turing-complete script, we may need to begin thinking of all this not in terms of a new language, but as a development of the order of language itself , but more on that later. \"Communicating value to each other is the basis of creating social bonds. Money is an important social tool .\" Money as linguistic technology is (and always has been) about the scale at which you can play your co-ordination game. The scale is now planetary. Are you ready to make your move?","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#for-the-skeptics","text":"\"Think about how often the technology of money has been transformed. Very basically, communicating value can take place through an exchange of things of equal value. The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. Then nothing for a few thousand years. Then came the idea that I can deposit my gold with someone trustworthy; they can issue a paper certificate for my deposit; and I can trade that paper. With every technological revolution in money, there comes skepticism; and this is the moment of greatest skepticism in our history. The move to paper was highly controversial. It took about 400 years for paper as money to become broadly accepted. Then, 60 years ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards were paper, but then Diner's Club in the US created the first recognizable credit card (which was originally a form of a traveler's cheque). Now we have Bitcoin which represents a new form of 'doing money' and is as radical as the change from precious metals to paper, perhaps even more so. This is because our history as a species has to do with tangible expressions of wealth, and now we're dealing with a network-centric form of money which is totally abstract.\" We're really looking at a phase change in the expressive power of money: i.e. it can now be programmed to do stuff dynamically in addition to being traded. Why does it matter that we now have a network-centric form of programmable money which is totally abstract? Well, what money is, how it is created, and who gets to distribute it goes to the very heart of the ways in which we are all incentivised to act. Incentives can be thought of as the social, political and neurobiological primitives which define what kinds of behaviours we express - individually and collectively - and therefore the kinds of conscious experience we value, both personally and communally. Programming such primitives in a network-centric manner, where meaning is arrived at consensually, provides no less than the possibility to broaden the horizons of human consciousness.","title":"For the skeptics"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value","text":"\"Bitcoin isn't just digital money (we already have that).

Liars and cheats Bitcoin began with maxim \"Don't trust, verify\" . That is, trust can only begin where verification ends. Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie. Because we can codify the ways in which it is possible to cheat, we can also write executable software rules, with deterministic results, that prevent cheating in the protocols we use to define and transfer value. This demonstrates how to use complementary opposites as a mode of thought to identify patterns of meaning. We can build protocols with strong trust guarantees by defining clearly, and encoding , what it means to lie. To understand trust, you must know the details of all possible deceptions. Such rules do not mean we need no longer trust at all. It means that there is an implicit shift from trusting those who own the media by which we transfer value, to those with whom we are actually transacting. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on this statement Vires in numeris The above is another early Bitcoin maxim which means \"Strength in numbers\". It goes back to Pythagoras, for whom \"All things are number\". The implicit shift towards trusting those we're actually transacting with is enabled due to a fundamental change in the language by which value is defined. Instead of regulatory fiat, enforced by legal prose and human courts backed by the threat of violence; Bitcoin enables a network of peers to create the conditions required for a functional currency through mathematics alone, enforced by deterministic computation. The saying holds this double entendre which implies both that using numbers and mathemtical consensus gives us the strength to lay down what Andreas Antonopolous will later call 'unassailable facts', while also pointing at that which gives power and meaning to any narrative: the community which believes it. The more succinctly we can express shared truths, the easier it becomes to verify (and therefore trust) the systems we use. This implies that \ud83d\udca1 Trust has something to do with truth. Publicly verifiable truth means more humans can reach consensus on the basic state of their shared realities and get on transacting in increasingly valuable ways based on new kinds of trust. It's a profound feedback loop : use a universal language (math) to define succinctly what it means to cheat, enforce penalties in a deterministic and executable way based on your definitions (code), which allows more humans to experiment with interpersonal trust in ways previously unimaginable. To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary. Access-ability Ultimately, we're not interested in trust based on blind faith. We're interested in deterministic verifi ability between peers. The Bitcoin source code can be audited by anyone, anywhere in the world - so it's not just ability we're interested in here, but also access . Trust, in a practical day-to-day sense, has a lot to do with transparency and education. This requires a certain kind of architectual innovation in the very structure of money: no more clients and servers; everyone needs to be a peer. Please read the next piece of curated material - Money Talks - to get a sense for what a peer-to-peer architecture of money is, and what money as a protocol might come to mean in our time. As Nicky Case highlights below, it all comes down to this fundamental game theoretic insight: we are each others' environment. Deeper down the rabbit hole Of course, all this raises the question, \"What is truth?\" Note that we're interested in shared truth above, i.e. consensus. Absolute Truth is beyond the scope of this course, though you can use the same framework to think about it. One does not approach an absolute by trying to define it, but through being clear about what it is not . If you are honest and clear enough, then whatever is left over after all your negation must necessarily be the truth.

The saying holds this double entendre which implies both that using numbers and mathemtical consensus gives us the strength to lay down what Andreas Antonopolous will later call 'unassailable facts', while also pointing at that which gives power and meaning to any narrative: the community which believes it. The more succinctly we can express shared truths, the easier it becomes to verify (and therefore trust) the systems we use. This implies that \ud83d\udca1 Trust has something to do with truth. Publicly verifiable truth means more humans can reach consensus on the basic state of their shared realities and get on transacting in increasingly valuable ways based on new kinds of trust. It's a profound feedback loop : use a universal language (math) to define succinctly what it means to cheat, enforce penalties in a deterministic and executable way based on your definitions (code), which allows more humans to experiment with interpersonal trust in ways previously unimaginable. To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary.","title":"Vires in numeris"},{"location":"module-0/trust/#access-ability","text":"Ultimately, we're not interested in trust based on blind faith.

The Bitcoin source code can be audited by anyone, anywhere in the world - so it's not just ability we're interested in here, but also access . Trust, in a practical day-to-day sense, has a lot to do with transparency and education. This requires a certain kind of architectual innovation in the very structure of money: no more clients and servers; everyone needs to be a peer. Please read the next piece of curated material - Money Talks - to get a sense for what a peer-to-peer architecture of money is, and what money as a protocol might come to mean in our time.

For that, we must turn away from the men and invite the sparkling character of May Li Khoe onto the stage. How does this fit into KERNEL? This wonderful presentation has been selected to deepen your appreciation of where meaning might stem from, how we can literally design our own perceptions and experiences of the world to generate more of it and thereby create value both for ourselves and the communities of which we are a part. Brief May Li begins by speaking about her mixed ancestry and the effect this has had on her approach to, and understanding of, value and meaning. As one of the designers who worked on the first iPhone, she has a unique perspective on the ability we have to design both. She also speaks about the US-sanctioned massacres in Indonesia in 1965 - one of the places she originates from - and how these, too, have effected the way she sees the structure of society and what she calls \"dominant narratives.\" \"Instead of thinking of life as a series of checks which I need to tick off - something which can be displayed on a graph that climbs ever up and to the right - I like to think of my life as a canvas which I can paint with whatever weird artwork I feel like [...] Here is my mandatory Venn diagram: the status quo needs to change, and life is short. When we put these two together, we can see that we need to subvert the status quo and have as much fun as possible along the way!\" It's colourful and light and funny, but also a deeply profound point. To illustrate further: the point of meditation is not to get \"good\" at sitting around, thinking about nothing: it is to turn your life into a meditative one. Every act itself a meditation. May Li talks about it in terms of turning the living of life into an artwork. The question is, what is the primary means we have a making art of our lives? This course will contend that it is designing dialogue . Therefore, we turn back and listen further: \"The first example is BBQ Becky, a woman who called the police on black people having a barbecue [... The response was to host a really massive barbecue and] the community has come together, everyone is welcome, thousands of people turned out. There was great food, and dominoes. And now it's a tradition! [...] The second example is called 'futbolistas 4 life' [...] Something that was important for a lot of the students was feeling like they had this space to play; and freedom and ownership over their play and their bodies in a place that felt good [...] 'Having a space like a soccer field where we can play and love one another: that's an act of resistance '.\" In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a society based on fear; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance. Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot. This is why we have unicorns and dancing developers and silly memes: it's not something incidental. It is a fundamental part of what borderless, global history-writing based on consensus is about. The revolution is not being televised because it's not about hate or anger or violence or anything else that grabs the headlines of a media operating with skewed incentives. It's heart to heart, here in the prison yards where we're using matching funds to build playgrounds where we can love again. Small things \"When you do these little, joyful subversions remember that they can be really small. They don't have to be these grandiose events with hundreds or thousands of people. When face-tracking came out, I managed to sneak little pink hearts into your Mac. At that time, there wasn't a lot of pink happening at all [laughs] It makes me happy to think I got Steve Jobs to approve this while pink hearts were coming out his head. Another example is the Technics 1200 turntables as your avatar - iconic in hip hop - and some other Easter eggs which are still in MacOS.\" May Li goes on to talk about Scribble Together and her approach to presentation. One of the examples she uses is the ability to \"stamp multiple unicorns\". Everything is connected. Experiment with format \"Another thing you can do is experiment with format [...] For instance, using this traditional talk format to instead make everyone dance [...] Another one is subverting technology. This one is pretty profound. We talk a lot about the epidemic of loneliness [...] somehow, we have accepted the fact that computation has to be locked behind these little rectangles [...] How many years are we into the journey of computers and yet we still accept that we can get locked into things like this!? What would happen if we turned computers inside out? There's an organization called DynamicLand which does exactly this. It's like cooking or scrapbooking; except it's all software and we're building things together.\" It's worth knowing a little bit about Bret Victor and the work him and people like him are doing on computation as a concept and practice, rather than just writing more software in a linear, boxed-in kind of way. Stay with this until May Li makes it rain purple across everyone's prototypes with a Prince override. We'll return to Bret later in the course. Create a space \"Creating a space for change does not necessarily mean you're doing it yourself; you're just making it possible for others.\" May Li discusses La Pelanga, a DJ collective she helped form that holds parties in the Bay Area and does interesting things with their celebratory space. The first one, for instance, raised funds for Haiti. Again: light, fun, colourful, and profound. I once had a friend who told me, \"I'm not all that interested in Jesus, you know. I'm much more interested in what on earth was going on with that water he walked on!\" By which he meant that real miracles occur when you provide the environment for others to achieve seemingly miraculous things. Minding Symbolism \"When you think about dominant narrative and the status quo, symbolism is a big part of that, because a lot of how we relate to each other is through symbols and stories.\" This time, May Li and friends took a traditional gallery space, built a replica of the proposed wall between the USA and Mexico out of pinatas and then hosted a big party to do what is traditionally done to pinatas: smash them up! The footage is a treat to behold. Building on history \"I think change is rarely straightforward and, unlike the covers of magazines tend to show, it doesn't happen with one person on their own. We have a lot of room to build on history, to build on all the tremendous work of people before us who have striven for a better world. One group of people who did something that was pretty important were the Black Panthers. One thing people don't realise about them is that they instituted a free breakfast program for children. We talk a lot about education and all the different statistics and projects there, but if people come to class hungry they cannot learn [...] This free breakfast program actually ended up being the blueprint for the Federal free breakfast program which happens today.\" May Li uses this example to discuss the People's Kitchen Collective. \"These are recipes of resilience. The strength of our communities is, at its heart, based on the meals we share together.\" Please ping Vivek to discuss the importance of food. He has many hot takes on this topic. Shifting the nature of work \"I spent many years in conference rooms and, at some point in time after being at Apple for a little while, I felt like I wanted to do something a little different and I wound up joining Khan Academy. There were a couple of reasons I was attracted to it: one of them was that they are a not-for-profit which is building software, and that's pretty rare. I thought, 'hmmm, what would happen if our incentive structures were a little different?' I wanted to democratize learning too, so the mission was really profound for me. And the last thing was about the culture , because I felt that the organization was really open to some experimentation with cultural shifts. \"We wanted to shift educational software from assessing students and just asking 'Do you get it yet?' to letting them explore magical worlds themselves where, for instance, understanding the mathematics would give you powers [...] And all kinds of interesting stuff fell out of it: visual and interactive properties of prime numbers and so on. \"People tend to have a very vivid imagination when they work in design: you actually, literally, have the tools and you're constantly drawing possible futures.

This is already outdated, but the premise is fascinating. The fight for liberty is not conducted with natural language in the form of political rhetoric: it is hashed out in technical protocols . What matters most is not what you say, but what function(s) you can get your language to execute.

Cryptography is so powerful, it is considered to be a munition by many governments. This is because it executes speech freely, without the need for legal or political protection, and therefore outside the realm of legal or political control. The Means Now we have widely-deployed cryptography used to secure our ability to speak freely about what we find to be valuable, without the need to trust corruptible institutions. It is a profound shift in the evolution of our ability to make meaning, in the most general sense. The means by which we make such meaning are not owned by anyone, and the medium - which is both a network and a scripting language - can be read in an essentially perfect way. That is, the functions our language executes produce deterministic outputs which are globally agreed upon. It gets even weirder, though. As Vitalik says in Understanding Ethereum ; contracts (code) and externally owned accounts (people) are both first class citizens on Ethereum. Simon de la Rouviere describes it thus: \u201cIt\u2019s doubtful that programs will develop the desire to connect for the sake of it (like we do), unless we program them to do it. However, the benefits of knowing that a computation was verifiably done is like inventing religion for programs [...] with verifiable computing protocols, a program will know the minds of other programs. Except, unlike biology, where it is imperfect, it will know exactly the state and processing capability. There\u2019s no longer this idea of servers of data and logic connected disparately through the network.\u201d The Heart of It So, what does Ethereum really mean ? Happily, the most accurate answers to this are to be found on block explorers, not in short essays. However, we can make an attempt in natural language here by considering our communal imagery - the eight-sided logo. The octahedron is the third of the five solids postulated by Plato to make up all the elements - earth, water, fire, air and aether . While discussing air in the Timaeus - the element with which the octahedron is associated - Plato writes: \"there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1)\". The word \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1 in Homeric Greek means \"pure, fresh air\" or \"clear sky\". It is also often translated as \"quintessence\": the material that fills the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere. The aether is the air of another realm, which nevertheless interacts with our own by virtue of the meaning we enact in our use of the four terrestrial elements. The octahedron is the middle solid, and therefore associated in more modern metaphysics with the heart; love; compassion; forgiveness; and healing. It has 8 faces, similar in a sense to the Noble Eightfold Path . As is the case with all Platonic solids, it is symmetric and so its reflection remains the same. Such shapes remind us that we are all just mirrors for each other. More practically, space frames are a commonly used architectural design, extended into octagonal trusses by Buckminster Fuller in his work on geodesic domes. Fuller is often quoted in crypto circles, with this being the go-to choice for many of his intellectual descendants: \u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u201d Further References \"To know is to possess, and any fact is possessed by everyone who knows it, whereas those who feel truth are possessed, not possessors.\" - ee cummings","title":"Meaning"},{"location":"module-1/meaning/#meaning","text":"\"When the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words retain their power.

The aether is the air of another realm, which nevertheless interacts with our own by virtue of the meaning we enact in our use of the four terrestrial elements. The octahedron is the middle solid, and therefore associated in more modern metaphysics with the heart; love; compassion; forgiveness; and healing. It has 8 faces, similar in a sense to the Noble Eightfold Path . As is the case with all Platonic solids, it is symmetric and so its reflection remains the same. Such shapes remind us that we are all just mirrors for each other. More practically, space frames are a commonly used architectural design, extended into octagonal trusses by Buckminster Fuller in his work on geodesic domes. Fuller is often quoted in crypto circles, with this being the go-to choice for many of his intellectual descendants: \u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u201d","title":"The Heart of It"},{"location":"module-1/meaning/#further-references","text":"\"To know is to possess, and any fact is possessed by everyone who knows it, whereas those who feel truth are possessed, not possessors.\" - ee cummings","title":"Further References"},{"location":"module-1/playdough-protocols/","text":"\ud83e\udd1d The Playdough Protocols Sealing the deal Read It The above essay is about the history of seals and how, using the digital equivalent of seals, we can bring data integrity and unforgeable identities to online commerce.

Until then, read on, because here is the meat of this article - how trade and money lead directly to the development of writing: \"The first documents ever written, in the 4 th millennium B.C., were about wheat and barley, and were sealed. Far earlier still, at least as far back as 8,000 B.C., archeologists have found even more salient artifacts \u2013 vast numbers of little clay tokens [...] Now we know that these tokens led directly to what are the very basics of our civilization \u2013 reading, writing, and arithmetic. Writing's Story \"Soon after 4,000 B.C., the clay tokens were combined with the idea of sealing to create bills of lading and warehouse receipts. To create a bill of lading for a consignment of sheep, the owner put in a one-sheep token for every sheep. Every time he counted five sheep, a five-sheep token could be substituted for a one-sheep token. Once the owner and the consignee agreed on the count, the tokens were placed in a wet clay envelope. The owner and the consignee rolled their seals over the envelope, then let it dry. [...] The receipt was tokens sealed in an envelope \u2013 when the owner got hungry, or wanted to sell to the hungry, or wanted the seed to plant next spring \u2013 he would take the envelope to the warehouse. The claimant and the warehouse operator would inspect the seal, break it, inspect the tokens, and then deliver the goods. \"It would be nice if one could learn the contents of the envelope \u2013 the number and kind of tokens \u2013 without having to take the ominous and irreversible step of breaking the seal. Around 3,400 B.C. in Sumer, marks started appearing on the outside of these envelopes. These marks were simply made by the tokens themselves. The different shapes and sizes of the tokens created correspondingly unique impressions, and thus the same symbols [...] \"With different tokens for one sheep, five sheep, one pot of barley, five pots of barley, and so forth, we get m * n different tokens [...] By creating separate tokens for the numbers and the goods, the number of different kinds of tokens were reduced to m + n , at the cost of up to twice as many tokens per envelope [...] \"The evolution of writing proceeded from there. A hundred years later reed styluses were being used to mimic the clay token marks. Over the centuries, scribes supplemented or replaced token-derived symbols with pictographs for the objects. The pictographs attempted to depict the object visually. Both kinds of symbols became stylized as wedges, or \u201ccuneiform\u201d, optimized for the reed stylus. Still later, words represented by neither pictographs nor token-derived symbols come to be represented by a rebus.\" And that's all she wrote! Well, not quite, but it is one of the more believable stories about the development of the written word and takes us into the very heart of what it is we're really innovating on in KERNEL. Sealing the Deal While historically fascinating, seals were not the only method of providing evidence of foul play: \"Along with the tamper evident clay, the Sumerians developed a kind of virtual tamper evidence. It took the form of two sets of numbers. On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately \u2013 for example on the front would be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded \u201c265\u201d \u2013 the same objects counted again, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them [...] Checksums still form the basis of modern accounting. Indeed, the principle of double entry bookkeeping is based on two sets of independently derived numbers that must add up to the same number.\" From here, Szabo describes modern means of providing tamper evidence and describes the use of cryptography - that is, secret writing - to provide both unspoofable checksums with one-way hash functions, as well as the development of digital signatures. So, what does this all have to do with Ethereum's state and history? Well, apart from providing the history of our civilizational evolution towards global platforms capable of ensuring data integrity at scales never before possible, which thereby allow for trade in ways and at scales not before possible, it also sets the scene nicely for some of the modules to come. Bitcoin and Ethereum are not some aberration of the digital, technological age: they are the next block in a timeless story about the evolution of trust and its concomitant effect on what it means to be human.

It's especially useful to look back and ask what of the original ideas we have succeeded in implementing, and where there are still opportunities for improvement. This video has been selected to assist you deepen your (more technical) understanding of: Value Trust Incentives Censorship resistance (Not just!) money and speech Brief This video is the genesis of the calculator (Bitcoin) vs smartphone (Ethereum) analogy and a demonstration of the power of generality... \"Instead of having a protocol that is designed around one very small set of use cases, you just create a general-purpose operating system and you let people build whatever they want as applications on top of it.\" Ethereum is a blockchain, with a few additions: Built-in Turing-complete scripting language - essentially hybrid between standard VM architectures, Bitcoin script and a \"few other things\". People can write programs in this script, or high level languages that compile down to this script, take these compiled scripts, put them into transactions and send them to the blockchain. The transaction gets confirmed and you get a special account at that address. Contractual accounts and Externally Owned Accounts have the same privileges . Anyone can create an application, with any rules. Anyone can then interact with that application, i.e. you can do NameCoin in 10 lines of code... State is defined as a key value mapping addresses to account objects. Every account object has a nonce and balance. Contract accounts also include a code hash and storage trie root. Vitalik then discusses how transactions work - important low-level details for us to build a full conceptual picture in the weeks ahead. \"You can actually think of it as being a fairly simple system. You can think of the state as being a database, and you can think of each of these contracts as being programs that are sitting on one computer, except the computer is massively globally distributed. It's actually a highly secure network backed by tens of thousands computers around the world. It's bold because it's important.\" However, this raises the spectre of \"The Halting Problem\", which Vitalik explains as being solved by gas: a fee for every computational step the computer must take, where there is a limit to computational steps possible per block. Virtual Economy This means there is no technical limit on what can be put in the data field of a transaction, but there is an economic one, as the more data you include, the more expensive it becomes. It was an extra 68 gas for every byte of data you include at that time, though it may have changed now. \ud83d\udca1 Exercise for the reader: how would you tell what the gas price per byte currently is? Vitalik then discusses some of the intricacies around v , r , and s from elliptic curve cryptography, and how v is an extra field used for public key recovery. He also provides further information on receipts and logs and why logs are cheaper and allow for efficient light-client access. Although it may sound boring, this is the heart of how we build censorship resistance tools. This is followed by a description of the Ethereum Virtual Machine : Stack - up to 1024 32-byte fields. Memory - just an infinitely expanding byte array, but the more you expand the byte array, the more gas you have to pay. Most of the limits aren't static, they're economic and you'll see this idea again and again. Storage - permanent for contracts. You can read and write to it. Environment variables - VM can access block number, time, mining difficulty, previous block hash etc. Logs - append-only storage in a specific block, not in state. Sub-calling - opcode by which VM can itself call other contracts. Vitalik then discusses ABI and RLP (recursive length prefix) encoding \"for people who are set theory geeks\". It may seem boring, but it is a demonstration of the early culture and how the people who built all this stuff really think. He follows this with an explanation of memory-hard algorithms for mining and why they were an innovation. Again, worth listening to for cultural context, but 23:50 - 28:57 is now a bit outdated. Vitalik also emphasises the fast block time (17s) and discusses uncles - which solve the \"stale rates\" of blocks that arise due to network latency. He makes the critical point that merkle tries are \"a construction that allows for compact, efficiently-verifiable proofs that a particular transaction was included in a particular block.\" It's not just transactions in the Merkle trie though; it's the state too: i.e. that storage trie root we talked about in the account object earlier. Understanding how this particular choice of data structure allows us to succinctly express shared state reveals why intimacy with low-level technical details allows one to build a comprehensive conceptual picture of how it all ties together, and what meanings any technology can be used to build. Generalised Compute So, you're less technical then Vitalik (i.e. all of us) and are wondering what this all really means? Well, the critical point is this notion of a general purpose operating system - one, monolithic virtual machine distributed across the world which is shared by everyone, owned by no-one and which can't be turned off without also turning off the internet. Even with Bitcoin, we got this feature that you could carry 12 magical words in your head across any border in the world, incant them into an internet-connected machine and have immediate access to value.

It's especially useful to look back and ask what of the original ideas we have succeeded in implementing, and where there are still opportunities for improvement. This video has been selected to assist you deepen your (more technical) understanding of: Value Trust Incentives Censorship resistance (Not just!) money and speech","title":"\ud83d\udca1 The idea"},{"location":"module-1/understanding-ethereum/#brief","text":"This video is the genesis of the calculator (Bitcoin) vs smartphone (Ethereum) analogy and a demonstration of the power of generality... \"Instead of having a protocol that is designed around one very small set of use cases, you just create a general-purpose operating system and you let people build whatever they want as applications on top of it.\" Ethereum is a blockchain, with a few additions: Built-in Turing-complete scripting language - essentially hybrid between standard VM architectures, Bitcoin script and a \"few other things\". People can write programs in this script, or high level languages that compile down to this script, take these compiled scripts, put them into transactions and send them to the blockchain. The transaction gets confirmed and you get a special account at that address. Contractual accounts and Externally Owned Accounts have the same privileges . Anyone can create an application, with any rules. Anyone can then interact with that application, i.e. you can do NameCoin in 10 lines of code... State is defined as a key value mapping addresses to account objects. Every account object has a nonce and balance. Contract accounts also include a code hash and storage trie root. Vitalik then discusses how transactions work - important low-level details for us to build a full conceptual picture in the weeks ahead. \"You can actually think of it as being a fairly simple system. You can think of the state as being a database, and you can think of each of these contracts as being programs that are sitting on one computer, except the computer is massively globally distributed. It's actually a highly secure network backed by tens of thousands computers around the world. It's bold because it's important.\" However, this raises the spectre of \"The Halting Problem\", which Vitalik explains as being solved by gas: a fee for every computational step the computer must take, where there is a limit to computational steps possible per block.","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-1/understanding-ethereum/#virtual-economy","text":"This means there is no technical limit on what can be put in the data field of a transaction, but there is an economic one, as the more data you include, the more expensive it becomes. It was an extra 68 gas for every byte of data you include at that time, though it may have changed now. \ud83d\udca1 Exercise for the reader: how would you tell what the gas price per byte currently is? Vitalik then discusses some of the intricacies around v , r , and s from elliptic curve cryptography, and how v is an extra field used for public key recovery. He also provides further information on receipts and logs and why logs are cheaper and allow for efficient light-client access. Although it may sound boring, this is the heart of how we build censorship resistance tools. This is followed by a description of the Ethereum Virtual Machine : Stack - up to 1024 32-byte fields. Memory - just an infinitely expanding byte array, but the more you expand the byte array, the more gas you have to pay. Most of the limits aren't static, they're economic and you'll see this idea again and again. Storage - permanent for contracts. You can read and write to it. Environment variables - VM can access block number, time, mining difficulty, previous block hash etc. Logs - append-only storage in a specific block, not in state. Sub-calling - opcode by which VM can itself call other contracts. Vitalik then discusses ABI and RLP (recursive length prefix) encoding \"for people who are set theory geeks\". It may seem boring, but it is a demonstration of the early culture and how the people who built all this stuff really think. He follows this with an explanation of memory-hard algorithms for mining and why they were an innovation. Again, worth listening to for cultural context, but 23:50 - 28:57 is now a bit outdated. Vitalik also emphasises the fast block time (17s) and discusses uncles - which solve the \"stale rates\" of blocks that arise due to network latency. He makes the critical point that merkle tries are \"a construction that allows for compact, efficiently-verifiable proofs that a particular transaction was included in a particular block.\" It's not just transactions in the Merkle trie though; it's the state too: i.e. that storage trie root we talked about in the account object earlier. Understanding how this particular choice of data structure allows us to succinctly express shared state reveals why intimacy with low-level technical details allows one to build a comprehensive conceptual picture of how it all ties together, and what meanings any technology can be used to build.","title":"Virtual Economy"},{"location":"module-1/understanding-ethereum/#generalised-compute","text":"So, you're less technical then Vitalik (i.e. all of us) and are wondering what this all really means? Well, the critical point is this notion of a general purpose operating system - one, monolithic virtual machine distributed across the world which is shared by everyone, owned by no-one and which can't be turned off without also turning off the internet. Even with Bitcoin, we got this feature that you could carry 12 magical words in your head across any border in the world, incant them into an internet-connected machine and have immediate access to value. Now, there is the possibility that you could pull down not just monetary value, but generalised compute .

It's now time to look in greater detail at money as it actually works in the modern economy. And it's really difficult to do this, because any classical economics textbook - even from the 1960's - is already outdated. The best resource we know, which is able to take both a long, historical perspective, but then ground it in the day-to-day realities of money and banking as they actually work in our era, is this course from Perry Mehrling and the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Some videos initially included in this course are no longer public, but you can find most of the MOOC if you look through the new playlists on the INET youtube channel linked above. How this fits into KERNEL You cannot ask better questions unless you understand something deeply. You cannot understand how to disrupt banks and the current financial system unless you know how we got here and what it actually is. This series grounds value, money, speech, and incentives in very real-world, practical terms. Literally the entire course is aimed at teaching you how to read the Financial Times and translate it into everyday language for your friends. While not a core learning objective for KERNEL, Mehrling approaches money and banking through the issue of liquidity , rather than solvency, and this is particularly relevant for anyone working on DeFi. Brief \" The analytical apparatus of this course is largely balance sheets. \" \"The two key ideas in this course are thinking of banking as a clearing systems - a payment system - and banking as market making. Additionally, banking as advanced clearing is how we bring in finance and forwards and futures and swaps and derivatives etc.\" If you watch the whole course, you'll see Mehrling use the classic T account over and over again to explain increasingly complex concepts. You'll realise that the T account, or balance sheet-style thinking, is just the banker's way of being able to hold in mind complementary opposites and demand, very practically, that they balance each other out. It is a powerful, and simple, way of understanding the flow of value anywhere in the world. Banks and shadows Mehrling starts by describing a simple bank: with loans, securities and cash as its assets; and deposits, \"other borrowing\", and a balancing item of \"net worth\" as its liabilities. If this seems familiar and boring, stay with it, because this course is really about that strange term \"other borrowing\", how it relates to the money markets, overnight lending, FedWire and shadow banks - all the stuff you were never taught about because they didn't exist in the form they now take, especially post-2008. Moreover, instead of focusing on a positive \"Net Worth\" - i.e. the solvency of banks - Mehrling is going to be looking at that Tamil word for Chinese money: cash and the liquidity problem, because this is actually the constraint bankers have to face at the end of every day when they \"clear\" their accounts. In many ways Mehrling's course is about payment systems and how they work in practice, and this is why it's so relevant in the context of peer-to-peer electronic payment systems, or open protocols for money. We have to understand liquidity and the different prices of money if we are to appreciate what it actually means to have a payment system which no-one controls, because it is ultimately these two constraints which will define what kinds of programmable money are useful, and what kinds will fail. \"We're also going to be talking about shadow banks , [by which I mean] an entity that is holding Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (loans that have been turned into a kind of bond), or Interest Rate Swaps and Credit Default Swaps to mitigate risk so that what is left is a short-term, relatively low risk asset that can be used as collateral for borrowing in the wholesale money market [...] So, you have money market borrowing as the liability. They're not borrowing from you and me, but from money market mutual funds and big corporate investors. The instruments they're using are things like Repurchase Agreements, Eurodollars (or LIBOR), and Asset-Backed Commercial Paper. The point is: this model is now the dominant one . The amount of credit in the US that runs through this method is much larger than through traditional banks, which is what the textbooks are all about.\" Shadow banking also faces the issues of solvency and liquidity, but it's more complex than in the regular system because the issue of liquidity is really about being able to roll over the funding for your RMBS, IRS and CDS. If the money markets freeze up, you can't roll it over and you have to liquidate. This is what a lot of the 2008 financial crisis was about. The course looks in great detail at the Federal Reserve, which is also a bank. Mehrling begins by discussing a 2012 Fed balance sheet and, for instance, the $852 Billion of mortgage backed securities it was carrying then. Very pertinently, Mehrling shows how \"It's just not correct to say that the Fed is 'printing money'. When it is expanding the money supply, it is expanding both sides of the balance sheet . It is a classic banking operation, which happens at all levels of the system.\" Whether you agree that it should happen is another story, but Mehrling takes great care to place himself in an esteemed intellectual tradition which may make you rethink your position. In any case: \"The system has changed dramatically. When people talk about Quantitative Easing 1, QE 2, QE 3 - they're talking about the transformation of the Fed's balance sheet that I am showing you.\" The 4 prices of money If we're really going to understand banking as a payment system - as well as the mechanics which underpin market making as a valuable activity - we need to understand what the different prices of money are and how they come about. Interest rate (future) - this is the price of money most economists focus on. It is the price of money now in terms of money later. It's how you transform money today into money tomorrow. However, there is a more primitive price which gets neglected in most thinking: Par (now) - the price of one money in terms of another money right now. We take it for granted that demand deposits and cash reserves in a bank trade at par. In financial crises, sometimes par is broken; where private money trades at a different price to central bank money. The hybridity of our system is masked by par, but it raises the question of why does par actually work? Par is critical to the payments system - i.e. par clearing between different states (for instance) was created by the Fed. It's not easy to create this, because it is akin to a fixed price, which spooks economists. Just ask the people at MakerDAO. Exchange rate (foreign) - the price of domestic money in terms of foreign, or world reserve, money. Which leads us to realise that there are, in fact, two dollars. This is well highlighted in the Triffin dilemma . Price level (commodities) - economists often reference this, imagining that the quantity of money moves one-to-one with the price level of commodities. \"In this course, we will not be taking sides - pro-banker vs anti-banker - we'll be trying to figure out how the system works so that we can approach this as scientists and citizens. The world has changed: it's a global financial world. The world of 1950's textbooks is not a world with private capital markets, and it's also not global, because the global markets of the 19 th Century had broken down. Bagehot is a better guide for today than Irving Fischer.\" That last sentence is the economist's version of a very hot take. Mehrling has a unique point of view which will assist you to uncover the actual inner workings of the \"tribe of bankers\" and how they think about the world so that you can program money both to account for the problems they're actually solving, and go a step further towards a more equitable world in which the bottom line is not the only thing we try to optimize. Mehrling is trying to connect the world of Finance and Banking, so we can move towards a more holistic understanding of the overall system. His motto for doing this is simple: \" All banking is a swap of IOUs . By swap, I mean IRS, CDS and the like, but also loans. The world of finance thinks they understand everything about swaps - derivatives etc. - but we're not going to be thinking of swaps in the terms finance people do, we'll be thinking of them in the way money people do, in that there is a funding and liquidity piece to swaps and that liquidity piece is what drives all the action [...] This is all about the question, 'What does financial globalization imply for money and monetary theory'? We're trying to develop monetary theory for the real world that is around us now.\" Discipline and elasticity Thinking in terms of liquidity and payment systems reveals a deep tension between fiscal discipline and elasticity . Mehrling introduces the image of a pyramid, made up of different kinds of money - ranging from Federal Reserve notes at the top, to credit instruments at the base. The critical point for our present study is that this beating heart, and the tension between elasticity and discipline, is currently managed by a group of unelected bureaucrats at the Fed. This is - to use Mehrling's phrase - neither a good nor a bad thing; it is a fact thing. They attempt to control the inevitable expansions and contractions through interest rates and various other, more contentious methods; like expanding the balance sheet and buying Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities and similar private instruments. If you're interested in why this is potentially not the optimal way to manage a global system, please read this book . Most importantly, programmable money means that we can code our financial systems to be responsive in ways which the current system simply cannot be. We can program stability in ways previously unimaginable. But, we have to understand how hard that really is, why it is so hard, and what the trade-offs in achieving it have been throughout history. This is not about destroying central banks - Mehrling will convince you of how useful they are (preservation of par being but one example). This is about changing the kind of money that sits on top of the pyramid from Federal Reserve notes to an ownerless, borderless, global, peer-to-peer ledger which holds us all equally accountable. It is about changing the ways in which critical financial organizations can respond to the needs of an global and interconnected system, and removing the possibility of corruption and manipulation to the greatest extent possible with the technology we have available. Further Recommendations Watch this video for more information on the deep links between money and violence - in this case the fascinating history of the Fed and the Civil War. Watch these videos to see a worked example of balance sheet-style thinking that will explain to you how credit cards actually work (fair warning: it's a mess). This snippet will help you understand source and use accounts, and how to think about money in both micro and macro economics. Watch this part of the course to understand how Central Banks are like clearing houses and how the entire system can be modelled effectively as one big bank. If you've got this far, you should just watch the whole course in your own time. I learned a lot from the videos starting here - Dealers and Liquid Security Markets. Stripe's Perspective One of the more interesting institutional perspectives on Bitcoin as the IP layer for payments. ETH - due to its generality - already takes this a step further: you can both browse a .eth site and send payments to the same place .

The world of 1950's textbooks is not a world with private capital markets, and it's also not global, because the global markets of the 19 th Century had broken down. Bagehot is a better guide for today than Irving Fischer.\" That last sentence is the economist's version of a very hot take. Mehrling has a unique point of view which will assist you to uncover the actual inner workings of the \"tribe of bankers\" and how they think about the world so that you can program money both to account for the problems they're actually solving, and go a step further towards a more equitable world in which the bottom line is not the only thing we try to optimize. Mehrling is trying to connect the world of Finance and Banking, so we can move towards a more holistic understanding of the overall system. His motto for doing this is simple: \" All banking is a swap of IOUs . By swap, I mean IRS, CDS and the like, but also loans. The world of finance thinks they understand everything about swaps - derivatives etc. - but we're not going to be thinking of swaps in the terms finance people do, we'll be thinking of them in the way money people do, in that there is a funding and liquidity piece to swaps and that liquidity piece is what drives all the action [...] This is all about the question, 'What does financial globalization imply for money and monetary theory'? We're trying to develop monetary theory for the real world that is around us now.\"","title":"The 4 prices of money"},{"location":"module-2/banking/#discipline-and-elasticity","text":"Thinking in terms of liquidity and payment systems reveals a deep tension between fiscal discipline and elasticity . Mehrling introduces the image of a pyramid, made up of different kinds of money - ranging from Federal Reserve notes at the top, to credit instruments at the base. The critical point for our present study is that this beating heart, and the tension between elasticity and discipline, is currently managed by a group of unelected bureaucrats at the Fed. This is - to use Mehrling's phrase - neither a good nor a bad thing; it is a fact thing. They attempt to control the inevitable expansions and contractions through interest rates and various other, more contentious methods; like expanding the balance sheet and buying Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities and similar private instruments. If you're interested in why this is potentially not the optimal way to manage a global system, please read this book . Most importantly, programmable money means that we can code our financial systems to be responsive in ways which the current system simply cannot be. We can program stability in ways previously unimaginable. But, we have to understand how hard that really is, why it is so hard, and what the trade-offs in achieving it have been throughout history. This is not about destroying central banks - Mehrling will convince you of how useful they are (preservation of par being but one example). This is about changing the kind of money that sits on top of the pyramid from Federal Reserve notes to an ownerless, borderless, global, peer-to-peer ledger which holds us all equally accountable. It is about changing the ways in which critical financial organizations can respond to the needs of an global and interconnected system, and removing the possibility of corruption and manipulation to the greatest extent possible with the technology we have available.","title":"Discipline and elasticity"},{"location":"module-2/banking/#further-recommendations","text":"Watch this video for more information on the deep links between money and violence - in this case the fascinating history of the Fed and the Civil War.

Too often, the people disrupting any industry don't understand deeply what it is they're disrupting. This is definitely the case with cryptocurrencies and the current financial system. It really is well worth your time to stop and become familiar with more history so that you can understand why we are where we are, what led us here, and - only then - what solutions might actually benefit you and those you care about. We'll provide you with a highly summarized version of the talk below, but recommend that you set aside some time and watch it in full. How does this fit into KERNEL? We're trying to provide as broad a perspective as possible on money, speech, value and trust: the core ideas which lie at the heart of building global, borderless, ownerless and decentralized products, services and protocols. Most importantly, you can't just hate on debt: you need to understand what it actually is and how we got to a world which runs on it and where we sit with a current global debt of $188 trillion. Brief Debt and morality \"[The book] grapples with a moral and political problem, which is: 'What is this hold that the idea of debt has over people's imaginations; that morality itself comes to be thought of as a matter of paying one's debts?'\" Graeber begins with a personal story and describes the \"Drop the Debt\" Campaign, or \"Jubilee 2000\". He was perplexed by most people's seemingly common-sensical notion that everyone absolutely should be expected to pay their debts, no matter what. He feels differently, and so began researching the history of debt, and discovered some surprising things. In particular: \"No-one has ever written a history of debt [...] You do find histories of money, which turn out to be mostly about coinage, which is interesting given that the vast majority of transactions through history have been on credit [...] and you do find histories of credit, but it's not exactly the same thing [...] I have found that most of our basic, common-sense assumptions about debt are completely wrong and that the moral ambivalence typified by the 'but you just have to pay your debts' conversation has been happening for about 5,000 years.\" We move from here into a discussion of Plato's Republic, the question \"What is justice?\" and how the book - like most major religions - takes the structure of 'OK, it's not that, maybe something else then?'. This is the style of thinking we pointed to in trust - you approach the truth only by negation. On this note: \"Debt, guilt, and sin are actually the same word in Sanskrit - i.e. life itself is a cosmic debt we owe to the gods [...] You owe a debt to your parents, so you become a parent; you owe a debt to the sages, so you become wise; you owe a debt to humanity, so you become humane. But this becomes absurd when we extend it - you're not really paying it back, even though the debt is annihilated by such action [...] Once you figure out what [the Vedas] are really saying it's that, in fact, you are the cosmos and so there can be no such thing as debt. \"The same thing happens in the Bible. In Arameic, the word for debt and sin is also the same word. Actually the Lord's Prayer - which we remember translated into terms of private property - is 'Forgive us our debts, just as we forgive those whom are indebted to us' [...] So what is sacred isn't actually paying back debts, it's forgiveness of debts .\" Put aside any institutional religious difficulties the above passages may present you with for a moment and see this point as it really is. \"Debt forgiveness is, in fact, a tradition going back to Mesopotamia and the Biblical Jubilee. It was considered a divine act [...] Over and over, we find this situation in our civilizational stories where people start with the assumption that debt and morality are the same, and then they are forced to accept that they aren't and have to cast around for some other basis for a universal morality, often encountering great difficulty along the way. It's even more complicated, because when you do think of debt as sin, there is a question of who is the sinner? \" Graeber references a Japanese Buddhist story to highlight this point. Stories like these are best listened to yourself (14:23). The problem it highlights is the moral peril on either side of a debt transaction and the ambivalence it reveals in the very nature of human sociality. Most interestingly, if we're concerned with the level of human exchange, then we only have a relationship with the other when the exchange is incomplete, i.e. when there is debt . The key to maintaining relationships in many older traditions is based on this ambivalence. Someone will give you something and the expectation is that you will give them something in return, though not something of exactly the same value as that would indicate you no longer wish to relate with them. A healthy community is one in which everybody is a little bit in debt to everyone else - it gives us an excuse to see each other! Communal credit \"97% of all transactions in England up until the 17 th Century were by credit. This was partly because there wasn't a lot of currency floating around, and partly because actual money is associated with violence, war and soldiers. Nice people operate on credit and trust.\" Of course, keeping a running ledger in your head of all your debts quickly becomes challenging, hence every half-year or year they would hold \"communal reckonings\", cancel the debt they could, and pay back the amounts still outstanding after a few loops. \"That's community! Community means everybody owes everybody else something and everybody remembers what they owe and eventually they all settle it and start over again. In this sense, debt isn't a terrible thing, but there's still this shadow of sin floating over it. Where does that come from? More generally: a debt is a promise which you can phrase in exactly quantifiable terms. Because you can quantify it, it's impersonal, and therefore transferable. According to some theories, this is what money actually is: a transferable promise. One of the great questions is how this came about? Why is there a need to quantify promises precisely?\" Adam Smith attempted a detailed description of this in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations, which has been accepted as the Economics 101 argument everyone now knows (and which you find in Shelling Out). However, it's not true if you take an accurate anthropological view of history. This false story starts with barter, which runs into the problem of coincidence of wants and the need to settle on one general equivalent and, through a virtuous feedback loop, this then becomes the standard and turns into money. The only problem with this story is that we have never found any evidence for an entirely barter-based society. The core issue here is the assumption that neolithic people would've only engaged in spot trades, which is not the case if we look at the anthropological evidence. In most societies, if someone praises your possession, it's almost impossible not to give it to them. Like debt, this phenomenon exerts a strange moral power over many people, even in the modern world. Graeber tells a Maori story here also worth listening to yourself (26:21). In these sorts of communities, there is definitely a quantified ranking system: a cow is roughly like a canoe is roughly like a good necklace. People can shirk this in all sorts of ways (because favors need not be repaid in a purely material sense), but if you do, you earn a reputation as a cheap skate, which is devastating in small communities. However, it is not possible to say exactly how cheap you are. Graeber then asks: \"How does this rough credit system - which we actually observe in places without money - turn into a system with exact proportional equivalence? The answer seems to be: when someone is really angry. When people are being nice to each other, there's no need to calculate [...] Very often it is the case, even in places where you don't have markets for goods, you do have very elaborate fines for personal damages [...] what they call the barbarian law code [...] So, in legal situations where there is the danger of a feud or outbreak of violence, people do need to quantify. This is the first circumstance in which something like money emerges.\" Currency and violence \"The association between money and violence is a constant and it helps to explain a lot about why debt takes on this incredibly powerful moral hold. If you are in a situation of violent inequality, probably the most effective technique ever invented to make it seem not only moral, but to make it seem like the victim is to blame, is to frame it in the language of debt .\" Mafiosi and the heads of conquering armies understand this all too well. Interestingly, taxes were only placed on conquered populations: they owe the debt of their lives and the conquerors get to be magnanimous benefactors while the victims end up subjugated for long periods. It's happened throughout history. However, history also proves that this eventually blows up in the victor's faces. This is because debt occurs between two parties who are at least potentially equal. Moses Finlay said that there was only one revolutionary program throughout antiquity, which was 'Cancel the debts and redistribute the land.' \"Why does debt motivate people across all ages in this way? Because it implies that you're equal! This is the inevitable conclusion of claiming that debt is morality. Suddenly the language of debt becomes all-pervasive, because you have to use the master's language and I think that's what we're dealing with in all these religious and philosophical texts which start by saying that debt is morality, but then end up saying, 'well, actually, it's not'. It's also why all this moral language becomes financial language, if you think about redemption and reckoning and so on. We're stuck with this language of debt, except that it periodically blows up.\" Remember that the story of barter \u2192 money \u2192 credit is not only wrong, it's backwards. We go back to ancient Sumer to discuss not just the clay tokens used to make the documents Szabo mentioned last week , but the fact that they're recording compounding interest rates. The evidence for this version of the story is scales , which - despite the available technology - were not accurate enough for small, daily amounts: i.e. people were running tabs. To avoid periodic social upheavals, or after winning wars etc., kings would declare a \"clean slate\" and wipe all (consumer) debt. This becomes systematized in the Biblical jubilee (every 7 to 49 years, depending on your reading). \ud83d\udca1 The first recorded word for freedom in any human language is the Sumerian 'ama-gi' which literally means 'return to mother', because that's what happened. Debt cancellation meant all the debt peons got to go home. It's bold because it's important. Virtual money, coins, and an ancient global system \"This virtual money system comes first, which is always entertaining because people have this tendency to write about virtual money as a new phenomena, as if we're in this brave new world, but actually it's the original form of money . Coins come later. Barter only tends to show up where you have people who are used to using money, but can't get their hands on any [...] \"Coins are an interesting case, because they appear in different places using different physical techniques, though the social situations were the same. In all cases, money in the physical sense - currency - is invented to pay soldiers.\" Graeber explains the reasons for this and demonstrates how cash markets - where they do emerge - tend to be in the regions where armies are parked. Governments quickly adopt this (another aspect of this story more convincing than barter, which cannot account for why governments demanded taxes in physical currency), because - in essence - it allows them to employ the entire population to get armies the things they need to survive and fight. \"Money and taxes have been used through the centuries as ways of creating markets. Which is interesting because we have this assumption that markets and governments are opposed principles and that political choice is largely about which one we are going to slant to: free markets or governments [...] Historically, in fact, markets tend to be created by governments as a side-effect of military operations. \"Coinage is invented around 600 BC in what Karl Jaspers called 'the axial age'. He pointed out that most major schools of philosophy and world religions developed in the exact same time and places where we invented coinage [...] World religions arise largely as peace movements against these empires that are using coins to fund armies.\" We're back to complementary opposites: in exactly the same place where we see the development of impersonal markets based on physical currency, we see the development of religions which emphasize the lack of importance in material goods. Gradually though, the empires dissolve, try to adopt religion - which doesn't really work - and we get the Middle Ages where all the gold is put into churches and monasteries, most people go back to local trust, and religions take over the regulation of elaborate credit systems. \"For example, most transactions in the market in Basra from 800 or 900 were done by cheque. This gives an interesting perspective on global markets; which are also nothing new. Cheque is, in fact, an Arabic word [and] cash is a Tamil word for Chinese money. How did that happen? [...] Again, it's not true that we reverted to barter in the Middle Ages [...] We used Roman money until Charlemagne, who never actually got around to making pounds though people still used them to measure. They actually called it imaginary money: an ideal system which spanned Europe with which you could trade on the basis of money that didn't exist. We even had a phenomena called 'crying up' or 'crying down' the currency, by which the king dictated value.\" He then discusses paper money in China and the move toward public currency, versus privatization in the Islamic world. It was Islam which led to the first real free market ideology. It's not about competition \"Adam Smith got most of his ideas and best lines from medieval Islam - like the pin factory, which actually comes from Al-Ghazzali in 1100 who spoke of a needle factory. It was made possible by shariah - civil law which bans usury and operates outside the purview of the state. As a result, we got the first true free markets. You could write a cheque in Mali and cash it in Indonesia and we get, for the first time, the idea that markets can run by themselves. But , since they have a real free market, which isn't enforced by the state, they don't assume it's about competition. The assumption is that it's all an extension of mutual aid .\" The world worked like this, except for Western Europe which was a barbarian backwater, until 1492 when a lot of new gold flowed in from the Americas; slavery came back, large empires came back and - to cut a long story short - that's the period which is ending now. 1971 and Bretton Woods is taken by most to be the key point of transition. We get credit cards and cashless transactions taking over in a generation, far more focus on financial capital, \"credit is gonna save the world and micro-credit will save the third world\", 401k's and mortgages and everything else which blew up in 2008. The question is, again, why ? \"The reason is because we're doing things backward. If we look at this from a broad, historical perspective, what we learn is that whenever you have a system of virtual money - in which money is not a thing, but a promise - you have to set up some mechanism to protect debtors. You could have periodic debt cancellation, or anti-usury laws and profit-sharing. Usually it's some kind of giant cosmological system beyond the purview of any state or king. We do set up giant, overarching institutions like this today, but we do so in the form of the IMF, which protects creditors against debtors. All these backward institutions produce the idea that nobody should ever default, which is absurd.\" In such a system, the distinction between actual slavery, and being so in debt that you sell yourself or your time every day is just a legalistic one. However, we're talking about 500 year cycles here, people are beginning to wake up, and we still have time to get it right. \"If democracy is to mean anything, it ought to mean that everybody gets to weigh in on what sort of promises are made, what sort of promises are kept, and - when circumstances change - what sort of promises are renegotiated. That's the political moment that we're in right now.\" Questions The Q A begins at 59:40. The first question has to do with what sort of risk-free rate of return on investment Graeber would impose in his perfect society, considering things like natural spoilage. That is, does money necessarily have to grow? \"Our entire perspective on what money should do goes back to arguments in the Middle Ages. Since usury was illegal, they came up with interest, which was really a late fee. You were not renting money, which is evil, but charging people for failure to return it on the basis that you could've earned ~5% by investing it had they returned it [...] But, I actually do think a jubilee would be reasonable. I end the book by throwing that out [...] because the very idea would allow us to reconceptualize what we're doing and realise that money isn't what we thought it was .\" The Boston Consulting Group actually modeled the idea of a jubilee and concluded that it would cause significant economic disruption, but rather less than if we didn't do it. \"I think we should start thinking about radically different forms of money entirely. Interest-free systems would be possible. The reason Islamic Banking doesn't work is because not everybody's doing it.\" Is there any precedent for the sheer amount of debt across the globe today? \"Probably not, though there have been many speculative bubbles. The real mystery is who is it all owed to? Everyone seems to be in debt, which is puzzling, in a way.\" Graeber references the Midnight Notes Collective and their notion of the 2 phases of capitalism after WWII. Since the 70's there has been a crisis of inclusion in the social benefits and welfare handed out in phase 1 and \"the deal\" is clearly off. Hence, we decouple wages and productivity, and give everyone political rights (which don't imply economic benefits anymore), but you can have credit . Again, everyone wants in on this deal, and the system inevitably implodes. Next question: if we protect the debtors, why pay back debt at all? \"If the government had paid back mortgages, that would also have bailed out the banks, but they chose not to and gave the money directly to the banks. This a pattern we see throughout world history: debt means something totally different depending on who it is between . Between equals, debt is just a broad moral feeling that you should come through. Between the big players, it's the same story. However, what seems to be treated as 'sacred' is not debt between equals, but debts between the people on top and the people on the bottom. All of a sudden it takes on a different color [...] The philosophy of debt as something which cannot be forgiven only ever crops up in situations of structural coercion and extreme inequality. \" How much of our sense of debt is biological, how much of it is from society and how much of it is regulatory? The answer is a bit tangential, but importantly, Graeber says: \"When you try to justify things in terms of the 'big picture', that's when you fall back on the language of debt and reciprocity. People tend to use this language to justify social relationships which operate according to completely different principles.\" Using massive foreclosures in SF as an example, what would it look like to build a movement for a jubilee? \"The vast majority of social movements throughout history have been about debt [...] The problem with organizing debtors politically is that debt is very alienating. Most people with student loan debt or mortgage debt don't actually know many others in the same situation and there is no forum to compare notes and come up with common strategies.\"","title":"Debt"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#debt","text":"This is a long video, but it has been selected nonetheless for two important reasons: It presents a different, and perhaps even more informed, view of the development of money than either Szabo or Antonopolous, which is worth taking into account.

Someone will give you something and the expectation is that you will give them something in return, though not something of exactly the same value as that would indicate you no longer wish to relate with them. A healthy community is one in which everybody is a little bit in debt to everyone else - it gives us an excuse to see each other!","title":"Debt and morality"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#communal-credit","text":"\"97% of all transactions in England up until the 17 th Century were by credit. This was partly because there wasn't a lot of currency floating around, and partly because actual money is associated with violence, war and soldiers. Nice people operate on credit and trust.\" Of course, keeping a running ledger in your head of all your debts quickly becomes challenging, hence every half-year or year they would hold \"communal reckonings\", cancel the debt they could, and pay back the amounts still outstanding after a few loops. \"That's community! Community means everybody owes everybody else something and everybody remembers what they owe and eventually they all settle it and start over again. In this sense, debt isn't a terrible thing, but there's still this shadow of sin floating over it. Where does that come from? More generally: a debt is a promise which you can phrase in exactly quantifiable terms. Because you can quantify it, it's impersonal, and therefore transferable. According to some theories, this is what money actually is: a transferable promise. One of the great questions is how this came about? Why is there a need to quantify promises precisely?\" Adam Smith attempted a detailed description of this in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations, which has been accepted as the Economics 101 argument everyone now knows (and which you find in Shelling Out). However, it's not true if you take an accurate anthropological view of history. This false story starts with barter, which runs into the problem of coincidence of wants and the need to settle on one general equivalent and, through a virtuous feedback loop, this then becomes the standard and turns into money. The only problem with this story is that we have never found any evidence for an entirely barter-based society. The core issue here is the assumption that neolithic people would've only engaged in spot trades, which is not the case if we look at the anthropological evidence. In most societies, if someone praises your possession, it's almost impossible not to give it to them. Like debt, this phenomenon exerts a strange moral power over many people, even in the modern world. Graeber tells a Maori story here also worth listening to yourself (26:21). In these sorts of communities, there is definitely a quantified ranking system: a cow is roughly like a canoe is roughly like a good necklace. People can shirk this in all sorts of ways (because favors need not be repaid in a purely material sense), but if you do, you earn a reputation as a cheap skate, which is devastating in small communities. However, it is not possible to say exactly how cheap you are. Graeber then asks: \"How does this rough credit system - which we actually observe in places without money - turn into a system with exact proportional equivalence? The answer seems to be: when someone is really angry. When people are being nice to each other, there's no need to calculate [...] Very often it is the case, even in places where you don't have markets for goods, you do have very elaborate fines for personal damages [...] what they call the barbarian law code [...] So, in legal situations where there is the danger of a feud or outbreak of violence, people do need to quantify. This is the first circumstance in which something like money emerges.\"","title":"Communal credit"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#currency-and-violence","text":"\"The association between money and violence is a constant and it helps to explain a lot about why debt takes on this incredibly powerful moral hold. If you are in a situation of violent inequality, probably the most effective technique ever invented to make it seem not only moral, but to make it seem like the victim is to blame, is to frame it in the language of debt .\" Mafiosi and the heads of conquering armies understand this all too well. Interestingly, taxes were only placed on conquered populations: they owe the debt of their lives and the conquerors get to be magnanimous benefactors while the victims end up subjugated for long periods. It's happened throughout history. However, history also proves that this eventually blows up in the victor's faces. This is because debt occurs between two parties who are at least potentially equal. Moses Finlay said that there was only one revolutionary program throughout antiquity, which was 'Cancel the debts and redistribute the land.' \"Why does debt motivate people across all ages in this way? Because it implies that you're equal! This is the inevitable conclusion of claiming that debt is morality. Suddenly the language of debt becomes all-pervasive, because you have to use the master's language and I think that's what we're dealing with in all these religious and philosophical texts which start by saying that debt is morality, but then end up saying, 'well, actually, it's not'. It's also why all this moral language becomes financial language, if you think about redemption and reckoning and so on. We're stuck with this language of debt, except that it periodically blows up.\" Remember that the story of barter \u2192 money \u2192 credit is not only wrong, it's backwards. We go back to ancient Sumer to discuss not just the clay tokens used to make the documents Szabo mentioned last week , but the fact that they're recording compounding interest rates. The evidence for this version of the story is scales , which - despite the available technology - were not accurate enough for small, daily amounts: i.e. people were running tabs. To avoid periodic social upheavals, or after winning wars etc., kings would declare a \"clean slate\" and wipe all (consumer) debt. This becomes systematized in the Biblical jubilee (every 7 to 49 years, depending on your reading). \ud83d\udca1 The first recorded word for freedom in any human language is the Sumerian 'ama-gi' which literally means 'return to mother', because that's what happened. Debt cancellation meant all the debt peons got to go home. It's bold because it's important.","title":"Currency and violence"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#virtual-money-coins-and-an-ancient-global-system","text":"\"This virtual money system comes first, which is always entertaining because people have this tendency to write about virtual money as a new phenomena, as if we're in this brave new world, but actually it's the original form of money . Coins come later. Barter only tends to show up where you have people who are used to using money, but can't get their hands on any [...] \"Coins are an interesting case, because they appear in different places using different physical techniques, though the social situations were the same. In all cases, money in the physical sense - currency - is invented to pay soldiers.\" Graeber explains the reasons for this and demonstrates how cash markets - where they do emerge - tend to be in the regions where armies are parked. Governments quickly adopt this (another aspect of this story more convincing than barter, which cannot account for why governments demanded taxes in physical currency), because - in essence - it allows them to employ the entire population to get armies the things they need to survive and fight. \"Money and taxes have been used through the centuries as ways of creating markets. Which is interesting because we have this assumption that markets and governments are opposed principles and that political choice is largely about which one we are going to slant to: free markets or governments [...] Historically, in fact, markets tend to be created by governments as a side-effect of military operations. \"Coinage is invented around 600 BC in what Karl Jaspers called 'the axial age'. He pointed out that most major schools of philosophy and world religions developed in the exact same time and places where we invented coinage [...] World religions arise largely as peace movements against these empires that are using coins to fund armies.\" We're back to complementary opposites: in exactly the same place where we see the development of impersonal markets based on physical currency, we see the development of religions which emphasize the lack of importance in material goods. Gradually though, the empires dissolve, try to adopt religion - which doesn't really work - and we get the Middle Ages where all the gold is put into churches and monasteries, most people go back to local trust, and religions take over the regulation of elaborate credit systems. \"For example, most transactions in the market in Basra from 800 or 900 were done by cheque. This gives an interesting perspective on global markets; which are also nothing new. Cheque is, in fact, an Arabic word [and] cash is a Tamil word for Chinese money. How did that happen? [...] Again, it's not true that we reverted to barter in the Middle Ages [...] We used Roman money until Charlemagne, who never actually got around to making pounds though people still used them to measure. They actually called it imaginary money: an ideal system which spanned Europe with which you could trade on the basis of money that didn't exist. We even had a phenomena called 'crying up' or 'crying down' the currency, by which the king dictated value.\" He then discusses paper money in China and the move toward public currency, versus privatization in the Islamic world. It was Islam which led to the first real free market ideology.","title":"Virtual money, coins, and an ancient global system"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#its-not-about-competition","text":"\"Adam Smith got most of his ideas and best lines from medieval Islam - like the pin factory, which actually comes from Al-Ghazzali in 1100 who spoke of a needle factory. It was made possible by shariah - civil law which bans usury and operates outside the purview of the state. As a result, we got the first true free markets. You could write a cheque in Mali and cash it in Indonesia and we get, for the first time, the idea that markets can run by themselves. But , since they have a real free market, which isn't enforced by the state, they don't assume it's about competition. The assumption is that it's all an extension of mutual aid .\" The world worked like this, except for Western Europe which was a barbarian backwater, until 1492 when a lot of new gold flowed in from the Americas; slavery came back, large empires came back and - to cut a long story short - that's the period which is ending now. 1971 and Bretton Woods is taken by most to be the key point of transition. We get credit cards and cashless transactions taking over in a generation, far more focus on financial capital, \"credit is gonna save the world and micro-credit will save the third world\", 401k's and mortgages and everything else which blew up in 2008. The question is, again, why ? \"The reason is because we're doing things backward. If we look at this from a broad, historical perspective, what we learn is that whenever you have a system of virtual money - in which money is not a thing, but a promise - you have to set up some mechanism to protect debtors. You could have periodic debt cancellation, or anti-usury laws and profit-sharing. Usually it's some kind of giant cosmological system beyond the purview of any state or king. We do set up giant, overarching institutions like this today, but we do so in the form of the IMF, which protects creditors against debtors. All these backward institutions produce the idea that nobody should ever default, which is absurd.\" In such a system, the distinction between actual slavery, and being so in debt that you sell yourself or your time every day is just a legalistic one. However, we're talking about 500 year cycles here, people are beginning to wake up, and we still have time to get it right. \"If democracy is to mean anything, it ought to mean that everybody gets to weigh in on what sort of promises are made, what sort of promises are kept, and - when circumstances change - what sort of promises are renegotiated. That's the political moment that we're in right now.\"","title":"It's not about competition"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#questions","text":"The Q A begins at 59:40. The first question has to do with what sort of risk-free rate of return on investment Graeber would impose in his perfect society, considering things like natural spoilage. That is, does money necessarily have to grow? \"Our entire perspective on what money should do goes back to arguments in the Middle Ages. Since usury was illegal, they came up with interest, which was really a late fee. You were not renting money, which is evil, but charging people for failure to return it on the basis that you could've earned ~5% by investing it had they returned it [...] But, I actually do think a jubilee would be reasonable. I end the book by throwing that out [...] because the very idea would allow us to reconceptualize what we're doing and realise that money isn't what we thought it was .\" The Boston Consulting Group actually modeled the idea of a jubilee and concluded that it would cause significant economic disruption, but rather less than if we didn't do it. \"I think we should start thinking about radically different forms of money entirely. Interest-free systems would be possible. The reason Islamic Banking doesn't work is because not everybody's doing it.\" Is there any precedent for the sheer amount of debt across the globe today? \"Probably not, though there have been many speculative bubbles. The real mystery is who is it all owed to? Everyone seems to be in debt, which is puzzling, in a way.\" Graeber references the Midnight Notes Collective and their notion of the 2 phases of capitalism after WWII. Since the 70's there has been a crisis of inclusion in the social benefits and welfare handed out in phase 1 and \"the deal\" is clearly off. Hence, we decouple wages and productivity, and give everyone political rights (which don't imply economic benefits anymore), but you can have credit . Again, everyone wants in on this deal, and the system inevitably implodes. Next question: if we protect the debtors, why pay back debt at all? \"If the government had paid back mortgages, that would also have bailed out the banks, but they chose not to and gave the money directly to the banks. This a pattern we see throughout world history: debt means something totally different depending on who it is between . Between equals, debt is just a broad moral feeling that you should come through. Between the big players, it's the same story. However, what seems to be treated as 'sacred' is not debt between equals, but debts between the people on top and the people on the bottom. All of a sudden it takes on a different color [...] The philosophy of debt as something which cannot be forgiven only ever crops up in situations of structural coercion and extreme inequality. \" How much of our sense of debt is biological, how much of it is from society and how much of it is regulatory? The answer is a bit tangential, but importantly, Graeber says: \"When you try to justify things in terms of the 'big picture', that's when you fall back on the language of debt and reciprocity. People tend to use this language to justify social relationships which operate according to completely different principles.\" Using massive foreclosures in SF as an example, what would it look like to build a movement for a jubilee? \"The vast majority of social movements throughout history have been about debt [...] The problem with organizing debtors politically is that debt is very alienating. Most people with student loan debt or mortgage debt don't actually know many others in the same situation and there is no forum to compare notes and come up with common strategies.\"","title":"Questions"},{"location":"module-2/engineering/","text":"\ud83d\udc8e Engineering money This Andreas Antonopoulos talk goes into more detail about the critical features of money and what being able to engineer them really means.

Most importantly, there is always a trade-off between the three. Gold is a great store of value, but a lousy medium of exchange. Visa is a great medium of exchange, but not really a unit of account, or a store of value (as it generally represents a form of debt). When you throw tokens on a blockchain into the mix, things become really confusing, and this is because we're using a descriptive term - \"money\" - without differentiating between its actual uses. How do we decide which \"things\" satisfy the trade-off between these three critical features in the most optimal way? We consider: scarcity, portability, durability, fungibility, divisibility, acceptability and stability. In this context: \"Metals aren't very good money, because they have some intrinsic value which is separate from the money it represents. Silver and gold can be traded independently for aesthetic reasons or other purposes. This destroys its fundamental function as a medium of exchange. \" This is a profound point: most people will tell you that intrinsic value is required to make money \"money\", but the truth is almost the exact opposite. Money is an abstraction, which allows us to speak meaningfully about the value of different items otherwise unrelated. If the medium we use to express such transactional relationship has its own intrinsic value, it is not a very functional abstraction. Changing the nature of control \"Metals represented for humanity an era when we used the materials we found around us in the world and adapted them to the uses for which they fit [...] Human beings looked around at found objects in the world and asked 'How do we take these materials that we have and find suitable uses for them?'

We began interacting with nature at a molecular level, turning wood into charcoal, or metal into alloys with unique properties better suited to our needs. Then came the ability to effect the atomic nature of materials: synthetic fertilizers, fabrics, and plastics etc. This is no longer about just finding materials and adapting them to our needs; it's about creating materials which fit uses we have preconceived . Today, we can effect the subatomic structure of things - manipulating nature at the nano scale to create carbon nanotubes etc. That is, we are not just manipulating the atomic behaviour of materials; we are giving them new physical properties. \"We just did something similarly amazing to money.

We accepted the compromise implicit in each type because we could not change its fundamental nature. Take paper money: great medium of exchange and unit of account; really terrible store of value because of its control architecture (don't tell your kids what inflation really does!).

How does this fit into KERNEL? This has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Reciprocal altruism and the problem of cooperation. The deep evolutionary links between money , mnemonics and genetic, generational memory. The importance of incentive structures to greater cooperation throughout human history. How money has been used in situations of low trust to enable trade that would otherwise not have occurred. Brief \"The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot \u2013 including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics \u2013 they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.\" Szabo begins with a story about the problems faced by the early colonists of America, who had limited access to the \"coin of the realm\", which was used to ensure they remained loyal subjects of the crown. They solved this by adopting the form of money used by the majority of Native Americans: wampum (or clam) shells. This strategy was so successful, and trade in wampum so widely accepted, that wampum became legal tender in New England from 1637 to 1661. Eventually the British shipped more coins to America and this practice ceased. \"The American language of shell money became a quaint holdover \u2013 \"a hundred clams\" became \"a hundred dollars\". \"Shelling out\" came to mean paying in coins or bills, and eventually by check or credit card. Little did we know that we had touched the very origins of our species.\" Again, this serves to highlight the idea that the language of money takes us back to well before recorded history, right to the very roots of homo sapiens sapiens , the wise ape capable of complex communication and its concomitant: the calculation of value. This practice therefore extends far back beyond Native American uses and includes examples from Spain to the Great Rift Valley in Kenya to even older sites further South: \"Recently regular shells, prepared as strung beads and dating to 75,000 BP, have been found in Blombos Cave in South Africa [...] The work is highly skilled, indicating a practice that probably dates much further back in time. The origin of collecting and decorating is quite likely African, the original homeland of the anatomically modern subspecies. Collecting and making necklaces must have had an important selection benefit, since it was costly \u2013 manufacture of these shells took a great deal of both skill and time during an era when humans lived constantly on the brink of starvation.\" Reciprocal altruism These strings of regular shells and other items may also have been used to satisfy our aesthetic tastes - made for sheer enjoyment. Far from an explanation, this raises a problem for evolutionary psychologists: why do people find the collection and wearing of jewelry enjoyable? What caused this pleasure to evolve? This takes us into a section about John Maynard Smith, evolutionary psychology, population genetics, selfish genes and Nash Equilibria. The critical question in all the theory is: how did cooperative strategies evolve? \"The situations where such cooperation in fact occurs in the animal world are highly constrained [...] The most common case is when parasites, and hosts whose bodies they share, evolve into symbiotes [...] However, there is much more than cooperation going on here \u2013 there is also exploitation. They occur simultaneously. The situation is analogous to an institution humans would develop \u2013 tribute [...] Some very special instances occur that do not involve parasite and host sharing the same body and evolving into symbiotes. Rather, they involve non-kin animals and highly constrained territory. A prominent example Dawkins describes are cleaner fish [...] The entrance costs, and thus the exit costs, of the relationship are high, so that it works out without cheating.\" After discussing vampire bats who regurgitate blood, most often to kin but sometimes to non-kin (the go-to example for evolutionary psychologists interested in reciprocal altruism), Szabo pulls a quote from Richard Dawkins which defines the rest of his essay: \"We will see that some humans, too, chose highly risky and discontinuous prey items, and shared the resulting surpluses with non-kin. Indeed, they accomplished this to a far greater extent than the vampire bat [...] Dawkins suggests, \"money is a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism\" , but then pursues this fascinating idea no further. We will.\" We've established through Antonopoulos that money is a language for communicating value, and that it was used long before writing was developed. This is now pushing to the heart of why language itself is useful at the biological, genetic level of our evolution: it fosters cooperation. In more technical terms, it allows us to overcome the value measurement problem - i.e. if you scratch my back in return for a piece of fruit, how long must you scratch for; how many ticks should you find; how big must the piece of fruit be; how do we remember who owes what in the case of delayed reciprocity? The cognitive overhead implied by this problem has never been overcome, except by homo sapiens sapiens. \"If clams can be money, furs can be money, gold can be money, and so on \u2013 if money is not just coins or notes issued by a government under legal tender laws, but rather can be a wide variety of objects \u2013 then just what is money anyway?\" This should be a question that you're becoming increasingly familiar with. Szabo quotes Carl Menger's theory that money arises from a sufficient volume of commodity barter and discusses the issues with barter that could've lead to its further development as an abstraction. Contrast this with the David Graeber brief, up next, to get a sense for the different approaches to this question. We tend to side with Graeber, but don't take our word for it! In any case, Szabo makes a profound and underappreciated point in discussing the problem of scale which arises with barter: \"With money, there are only n prices \u2013 500 products, 500 prices. Money for this purpose can work either as a medium of exchange or simply as a standard of value \u2013 as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large to memorize or change too often.\" Money has a price! There are, in fact, different prices for different kinds of money, hence the Perry Mehrling lectures in this section. Though it's not expected you watch them all, the ones we have selected will give you much deeper insight into this simple, though surprising, fact. Szabo goes on to define early forms of money like wampum shells as \"collectibles\" and uses this to illustrate why \"people, clans or tribes trade voluntarily: because both sides believe they gain something.\" Trade benefits from lowered transaction costs, which are exactly where collectibles serve usefully, apart from their aesthetic or sentimental value. He describes: \"how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer \u2013 in the voluntary free gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary transfers of legal judgments and tribute [...] Durable collectibles, what today we would call heirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer \u2013 often making the transfer even possible at all.\" We'll be exploring this idea later in the course through the context of gifts, which we feel provide another, perhaps more profound, level of understanding to these types of transactions, but Szabo's argument about lowered transaction costs is nevertheless well worth reflecting on. He goes on to provide a most fascinating example: the Kula trading network of pre-colonial Melanesia. Most interestingly, in the context of money as a language: \"The Kula valuables doubled as \"high power\" money and mnemonic for stories and gossip . Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in kind. Kula collectibles solved this double-coincidence problem as an unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!) money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a very regular pattern.\" \ud83d\udca1 Communicating value and transferring it are one and the same thing; it's just that media which are not perfect abstractions - which have their own, intrinsic value - obfuscate this essential fact. Communicative Wealth In analyzing such wealth transfers, we need to keep two things in mind: context (the time it occurs at and the supply/demand at that moment) as well as what Szabo calls the \"flow graph of monetary circulation\" which allows collectibles to accrue value over time. For example, food is worth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones. However, the trust required to make the requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so collectibles substituted for otherwise necessary but non-existent long-term trust relationships. In tandem with this kind of \"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a theory of trade-based predation - pointing out that many paleolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated seasonally, i.e. reindeer or bison. Importantly: \"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that single beneficial trades were possible. We must identify closed loops of mutually beneficial trades. With closed loops the collectibles continue to circulate, amortizing their costs.\" We're now deep down the evolutionary rabbit hole, and there's yet more ground to cover, because collectibles are not only useful for starvation insurance: they can be used to trade abstract foraging rights, as is still the case with !Kung in Southern Africa today. Nevertheless the major point remains that underneath our great economic institutions are far more ancient institutions that also involved wealth transfer . Most importantly, this kind of transfer can be passed between generations : i.e. kin altruism beyond the grave. \"The demand for a durable and general store of wealth for use in marriage, inheritance, dispute resolution, and tribute was thus even more urgent than for trade itself. Furthermore, these institutions may predate inter-tribal trade, and involved for most tribes a greater transfer of wealth than trade. These institutions, more than trade, served as the motivator and incubator of the earliest primitive money.\" This is a contentious argument, but the point remains that collectibles act as a container for memory across generations, and our memories of who we are and what we owe extend far beyond mere trade relationships. Mnemonics \"Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.\" This has always been true, and in an even deeper sense that Szabo is getting at here. Wealth is itself a mnemonic, perfectly illustrated by the fact that you now need only remember a 12 word mnemonic, which you can carry in your mind across any border in the world, in order to have immediate access to wealth. Szabo then discusses gifts and other forms of wealth transfer like family trade and marriage, putting particular emphasis on this notion of the closed loop of circulating collectibles, as well as tribute and the spoils of war. Again, when paying tribute: \"Collectibles doubled as a primitive mnemonic device that, while not verbatim, could be used as an aid to recall the terms of the treaty.\" Circulating collectibles highlight the link between money, language, mnemonics, and memory (both individual and collective). Money contains the memories of our indebtedness to each other; narrative contains the memories of our indebtedness to life, the universe and everything. What happens now that the two are merging? Another critical point that comes up in the section on Spoils of War is that tribes would often hide wealth in order to reduce the tribute they were forced to pay. This remains true today, albeit it in a more complex way. There is a very good reason we use the words \"shell corporation\". The innovation of a public, auditable, verifiable ledger changes this fundamentally, with hard-to-predict effects. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on the two points above. Taxes and coins Szabo uses these sneaky tribal tactics as a segue into the work of Arthur Laffer, who proved that as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate, due to increased avoidance, evasion, and - most of all - disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. This has become known as the Laffer Curve: \"On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Charles Adams uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives \u2013 both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments \u2013 to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\" We then move from collectibles to coins. Specifically, this was begun by a Greek-speaking culture in Anatolia (modern Turkey): the Lydians, whose kings were the first major issuers of coins. The main question about coins is why minting was dominated by governments as opposed to private interests - and the answer is not just the government's ability to enforce anti-counterfeit measures more effectively. It has to do with the fact that coins are high velocity money, facilitating a large number of low value trades. \"The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure to value of wealth held and exchanged by his subjects more accurately. That the exchange also benefited from cheaper measurement by traders of the medium of exchange, creating something closer to efficient markets, and allowing individuals to enter into the marketplace on a larger scale for the first time, was for the king a fortuitous side effect.\" Being from the internet, we reject kings, presidents and voting; opting rather for rough consensus and running code. The question is whether we can have efficient marketplaces without central authorities such that the fortuitous side effects of global trade can accrue to the people actually trading, rather than the authorities \"allowing\" that trade to occur. Resolution Human relationships of any kind generally require some kind of dispute resolution mechanisms in order to be sustainable in the long term. Szabo tackles this thorny issue next: \"Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment.\" There is a lot more to be said about dispute resolution, but we selected this particular quote because it highlights a fundamentally important idea for Web 3: is anyone willing to advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record? Because it's the perfect tool to do so. We can use economics to combat economic evils like the privatization of prisons. It may seem far-fetched, but these are the kind of society-level changes we want you to think about, because they are, in principle, possible. This takes us back to the primary importance of understanding this notion of collectibles: \"Indeed, collectibles provided a fundamental improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism , allowing humans to cooperate in ways unavailable to other species. For them, reciprocal altruism is severely limited by unreliable memory. Some other species have large brains, build their own homes, or make and use tools. No other species has produced such an improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism. The evidence indicates this new development had matured by 40,000 B.P.\" Szabo goes on to discuss the properties of such collectibles and gives multiple examples of their development through history, basically linking up everything above. Importantly, he makes the point in the context of all this history, that \"A novelty of the 20 th century was the issue of fiat currencies by governments. While generally excellent as a media of exchange, fiat currencies have proven to be very poor stores of value [due mainly to inflation].\" It's fascinating to consider the money we use today as a novelty, rather than a given. In any case, we then arrive at the conclusion: Collectibles were crucial in lowering transaction costs such that our ancestors could trade between tribes and not just with kin, without succumbing to either the value measurement problem or the prisoner's dilemma. Collectibles entirely replaced reputation as the enforcer of reciprocation, although violence still played a major role in enforcing rights as well as being a high transaction cost that prevented most kinds of trade. To be useful as a general-purpose store of wealth and means of wealth transfer, a collectible had to have certain functional properties and be embedded in at least one institution with a closed-loop cycle, so that the cost of discovering and/or manufacturing the object was amortized over multiple transactions. With its unprecedented technology of cooperation, humans have become the most fearsome predator ever seen on the planet.","title":"Shells"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#recollecting-our-origins","text":"Shelling Out Read It This Nick Szabo article, originally published in 2002, has been selected because it provides a detailed historical backdrop which we will both challenge and build upon in the curated materials that follow.","title":"\ud83d\udd30 Recollecting Our Origins"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#how-does-this-fit-into-kernel","text":"This has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Reciprocal altruism and the problem of cooperation.

Contrast this with the David Graeber brief, up next, to get a sense for the different approaches to this question. We tend to side with Graeber, but don't take our word for it! In any case, Szabo makes a profound and underappreciated point in discussing the problem of scale which arises with barter: \"With money, there are only n prices \u2013 500 products, 500 prices. Money for this purpose can work either as a medium of exchange or simply as a standard of value \u2013 as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large to memorize or change too often.\" Money has a price! There are, in fact, different prices for different kinds of money, hence the Perry Mehrling lectures in this section. Though it's not expected you watch them all, the ones we have selected will give you much deeper insight into this simple, though surprising, fact. Szabo goes on to define early forms of money like wampum shells as \"collectibles\" and uses this to illustrate why \"people, clans or tribes trade voluntarily: because both sides believe they gain something.\" Trade benefits from lowered transaction costs, which are exactly where collectibles serve usefully, apart from their aesthetic or sentimental value. He describes: \"how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer \u2013 in the voluntary free gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary transfers of legal judgments and tribute [...] Durable collectibles, what today we would call heirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer \u2013 often making the transfer even possible at all.\" We'll be exploring this idea later in the course through the context of gifts, which we feel provide another, perhaps more profound, level of understanding to these types of transactions, but Szabo's argument about lowered transaction costs is nevertheless well worth reflecting on. He goes on to provide a most fascinating example: the Kula trading network of pre-colonial Melanesia. Most interestingly, in the context of money as a language: \"The Kula valuables doubled as \"high power\" money and mnemonic for stories and gossip . Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in kind. Kula collectibles solved this double-coincidence problem as an unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!) money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a very regular pattern.\" \ud83d\udca1 Communicating value and transferring it are one and the same thing; it's just that media which are not perfect abstractions - which have their own, intrinsic value - obfuscate this essential fact.","title":"Reciprocal altruism"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#communicative-wealth","text":"In analyzing such wealth transfers, we need to keep two things in mind: context (the time it occurs at and the supply/demand at that moment) as well as what Szabo calls the \"flow graph of monetary circulation\" which allows collectibles to accrue value over time. For example, food is worth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones. However, the trust required to make the requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so collectibles substituted for otherwise necessary but non-existent long-term trust relationships. In tandem with this kind of \"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a theory of trade-based predation - pointing out that many paleolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated seasonally, i.e. reindeer or bison. Importantly: \"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that single beneficial trades were possible. We must identify closed loops of mutually beneficial trades. With closed loops the collectibles continue to circulate, amortizing their costs.\" We're now deep down the evolutionary rabbit hole, and there's yet more ground to cover, because collectibles are not only useful for starvation insurance: they can be used to trade abstract foraging rights, as is still the case with !Kung in Southern Africa today. Nevertheless the major point remains that underneath our great economic institutions are far more ancient institutions that also involved wealth transfer . Most importantly, this kind of transfer can be passed between generations : i.e. kin altruism beyond the grave. \"The demand for a durable and general store of wealth for use in marriage, inheritance, dispute resolution, and tribute was thus even more urgent than for trade itself. Furthermore, these institutions may predate inter-tribal trade, and involved for most tribes a greater transfer of wealth than trade. These institutions, more than trade, served as the motivator and incubator of the earliest primitive money.\" This is a contentious argument, but the point remains that collectibles act as a container for memory across generations, and our memories of who we are and what we owe extend far beyond mere trade relationships.","title":"Communicative Wealth"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#mnemonics","text":"\"Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.\" This has always been true, and in an even deeper sense that Szabo is getting at here. Wealth is itself a mnemonic, perfectly illustrated by the fact that you now need only remember a 12 word mnemonic, which you can carry in your mind across any border in the world, in order to have immediate access to wealth. Szabo then discusses gifts and other forms of wealth transfer like family trade and marriage, putting particular emphasis on this notion of the closed loop of circulating collectibles, as well as tribute and the spoils of war. Again, when paying tribute: \"Collectibles doubled as a primitive mnemonic device that, while not verbatim, could be used as an aid to recall the terms of the treaty.\" Circulating collectibles highlight the link between money, language, mnemonics, and memory (both individual and collective). Money contains the memories of our indebtedness to each other; narrative contains the memories of our indebtedness to life, the universe and everything. What happens now that the two are merging? Another critical point that comes up in the section on Spoils of War is that tribes would often hide wealth in order to reduce the tribute they were forced to pay. This remains true today, albeit it in a more complex way. There is a very good reason we use the words \"shell corporation\". The innovation of a public, auditable, verifiable ledger changes this fundamentally, with hard-to-predict effects. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on the two points above.","title":"Mnemonics"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#taxes-and-coins","text":"Szabo uses these sneaky tribal tactics as a segue into the work of Arthur Laffer, who proved that as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate, due to increased avoidance, evasion, and - most of all - disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. This has become known as the Laffer Curve: \"On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Charles Adams uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives \u2013 both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments \u2013 to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\" We then move from collectibles to coins. Specifically, this was begun by a Greek-speaking culture in Anatolia (modern Turkey): the Lydians, whose kings were the first major issuers of coins. The main question about coins is why minting was dominated by governments as opposed to private interests - and the answer is not just the government's ability to enforce anti-counterfeit measures more effectively. It has to do with the fact that coins are high velocity money, facilitating a large number of low value trades. \"The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure to value of wealth held and exchanged by his subjects more accurately. That the exchange also benefited from cheaper measurement by traders of the medium of exchange, creating something closer to efficient markets, and allowing individuals to enter into the marketplace on a larger scale for the first time, was for the king a fortuitous side effect.\" Being from the internet, we reject kings, presidents and voting; opting rather for rough consensus and running code. The question is whether we can have efficient marketplaces without central authorities such that the fortuitous side effects of global trade can accrue to the people actually trading, rather than the authorities \"allowing\" that trade to occur.","title":"Taxes and coins"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#resolution","text":"Human relationships of any kind generally require some kind of dispute resolution mechanisms in order to be sustainable in the long term. Szabo tackles this thorny issue next: \"Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment.\" There is a lot more to be said about dispute resolution, but we selected this particular quote because it highlights a fundamentally important idea for Web 3: is anyone willing to advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record? Because it's the perfect tool to do so. We can use economics to combat economic evils like the privatization of prisons. It may seem far-fetched, but these are the kind of society-level changes we want you to think about, because they are, in principle, possible. This takes us back to the primary importance of understanding this notion of collectibles: \"Indeed, collectibles provided a fundamental improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism , allowing humans to cooperate in ways unavailable to other species. For them, reciprocal altruism is severely limited by unreliable memory. Some other species have large brains, build their own homes, or make and use tools. No other species has produced such an improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism. The evidence indicates this new development had matured by 40,000 B.P.\" Szabo goes on to discuss the properties of such collectibles and gives multiple examples of their development through history, basically linking up everything above. Importantly, he makes the point in the context of all this history, that \"A novelty of the 20 th century was the issue of fiat currencies by governments. While generally excellent as a media of exchange, fiat currencies have proven to be very poor stores of value [due mainly to inflation].\" It's fascinating to consider the money we use today as a novelty, rather than a given. In any case, we then arrive at the conclusion: Collectibles were crucial in lowering transaction costs such that our ancestors could trade between tribes and not just with kin, without succumbing to either the value measurement problem or the prisoner's dilemma. Collectibles entirely replaced reputation as the enforcer of reciprocation, although violence still played a major role in enforcing rights as well as being a high transaction cost that prevented most kinds of trade. To be useful as a general-purpose store of wealth and means of wealth transfer, a collectible had to have certain functional properties and be embedded in at least one institution with a closed-loop cycle, so that the cost of discovering and/or manufacturing the object was amortized over multiple transactions. With its unprecedented technology of cooperation, humans have become the most fearsome predator ever seen on the planet.","title":"Resolution"},{"location":"module-3/","text":"\ud83c\udf10 Take Back the Web Why did the initial visions for the world wide web not work out quite as their inventors intended?

This primary focus on intention and expectation is inspired by Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning , but you can find some version of it across nearly all the world's major wisdom traditions. We need not express it using spiritual or psychological language though, because this is all about developing the patterns of thought most well-suited to our particular context. What's unique about web3 - about economic code which creates new trust spaces; expands the possible definitions of value; merges money and speech; and creates new constraints in which to experiment with freedom - is that we can encode our intentions , literally. Most importantly, the code with which we express our inner world and meaning then lives independently of us on a shared, global network where it will not change. Revolutions always end up failing because they are reliant on people who are error-prone, corruptible, and whose priorities change over time. However, a smart contract I wrote that expresses a particular economic ideal , which is now deployed on mainnet, will remain there irrespective of what happens to me. There is no bribe or threat which can get me to change this. I literally cannot take it back, even if my life depends on it. Timechains whose record of history cannot be reverted hold us to a higher standard of intentionality. Now we must develop the inner tools required to live up to our technology.

Brief Introduction Web 3 is a part of a larger phase transition in our internet (and our society) in which we're moving from a pre-computing to a post-computing civilization. This is happening at break-neck speed in terms of the evolutionary history of our species, though it simultaneously feels slow to us as individuals now used to communicating at light-speed with anyone, anywhere. Think of it in terms of periodic waves: - mainframes - computers - GUIs - the internet - the web - web 2.0 - mobile - blockchains - web 3 Can you imagine where we'll be in 40 years? However, exact developments in this sort of timeframe are extremely difficult to predict... \"The choices that we make in the technologies we build - the properties we give our products - will have drastic implications not just for ourselves, but for many people in the future.\" Juan then details the key questions which define and constrain the superpowers bestowed by each new wave: How do they work? How reliable and correct are they? How open and accessible are they? How safe are they? How can they fail? Who controls them and how are they governed? What rights do they secure/guarantee/grant people? \"We must be very careful about the things we build. We should care about maximizing human potential; promoting rights; and the long-term flourishing of humanity when thinking about the technologies we create.\" History There is a difference between \"the internet\": the wires and networking protocols which evolved mostly from military and academic work from the 1960's and 70's onward; and \"the web\": hyperlinked documents, static pages and browsers etc. Web 1.0 ( 1991 to 2000) Mostly static, read-only content. This also marks the beginning of \"online\" commercial activity. Web 2.0 (the early 2000's). It's key characteristic is its dynamic, interactive nature as opposed to the largely static content of the 90's. It's often described as \"the read-write web\" and is more participatory, social, and market-based. This includes not only Facebook and Twitter, but also services like Uber and AirBnB. However, The advertising model in Web 2.0 is broken. It optimizes for time spent on pages and tries to keep people and their data locked in. Anger is a great way to generate clicks, so we're increasingly optimizing for negative emotions in order to pay the bills. Web 3.0 (now) This next iteration of the web gives us read, write and trust . Web 1.0 was about linking content together. Web 2.0 was about linking programs to that content and building rich, dynamic applications which work across our devices. Web 3.0 is about linking content and programs directly to each other, removing intermediaries and gaining public verifiability. Web 3.0 is turning centralized applications into decentralized protocols. The path forward The aim for us should be to take what Bitcoin did to money and do it to all kinds of services and applications. Bitcoin \"thawed the peer-to-peer winter and reminded everyone that we can build these kinds of systems and succeed.\" Now, it's time to hook into the larger movement happening across the internet to change how the web itself works: how we store, retrieve and consult the shared record of human knowledge. The simple property of verifiability is the key to all this. The \"ability to check\" is as powerful as the ability to hyperlink text in your documents was in Web 1.0. It's a new kind of linguistic primitive. Most people do not understand this , similar to how hyperlinks were misunderstood early in protocol development. Free thought It is not just blockchains. It's \"the decentralized web\" in general. Blockchains systematize economics and law, and did not actually start in the web - Bitcoin was a protocol built to run separately without needing a browser. So a big part of Web 3 work is to make these things actually talk to each other: to make blockchains accessible to people . This goes to the heart of safer, more resilient, and more ethical protocols which can literally encode social contracts in ways which are visible and meaningful to the people using them. Open services and market protocols are what we're really able to build in Web 3.0. The old economic truths which sunk open source p2p software in the past are no longer true. We can now create commodities out of things that were fixed resources: i.e. storage, computation, and bandwidth. This will allow p2p to compete with centralized alternatives. Smart contract systems are the basis of jurisdictions. They are computable law and it is unlikely that we will tap the full potential of this for many years to come. So, if you want to bake rights into your systems and \"lock the web open\" as many of us do, then think about what it means to encode rules into the jurisdiction of the internet, because that's what is really happening here. In a way, the internet is becoming a nation. See J. P. Barlow's Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace . The other web 3 The linked data, semantic web actually coined the term \"Web 3\" back in 2004. This idea was started by Tim Berners-Lee , and is aimed at making everything interoperable, removing intermediaries and decentralizing the control of information. His approach has been to model ontologies and data so as to connect computers on the machine-readable web. The most successful Linked Data work ended up powering the Knowledge Graph and the Facebook Open Graph, which is a far cry from the decentralized vision which started it all. Much like the work on transformative tools for thought, this is due to issues around funding public goods which - if nothing else - blockchains can genuinely help solve. The decentralized web movement, the blockchain movement, and the linked data movement are all part of Web 3. We're in it to build a permanent, ownerless, and borderless foundation for this connected global community of which we are all a part.","title":"Lock It Open"},{"location":"module-3/lock-it-open/#lock-the-web-open","text":"\"Web 3.0 is an executable Magna Carta - the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot.\" - Gavin Wood In this video, Juan Benet shows how \"Web 3\" relates to a larger movement happening across the internet right now, aimed at re-imagining how we share and relate.

To establish our first pillar, we'll mix a Vannevar Bush essay from 1945 and a 2019 essay from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen: As We May Think Think Transformative Tools for Thought Again How does this fit into KERNEL? We must be clear on what \"taking back the web\" means. The internet came with grand dreams, though we're mostly stuck with artificial social spaces, overwhelming algorithms, and extractive incentives which are mining our attention as a means of propping up a failing economy. These two essays draw out a common thread of thought stretched across 74 years in order to illustrate what sorts of freedom are actually on offer in this world wide web of ours. Since 1945, one critical feature has revolved around constructing new media for free and creative thought. At first it may seem unrelated to blockchains, but tools for thought are public goods and suffer from the same problem of incentives as all other public goods. They are thus the perfect example of paradigm shifts which require us to understand why programming regenerative incentives matters, and what economic code can really be used to achieve in the long-term. \"The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.\" Brief We'll be taking great liberties by summarizing these seminal essays extensively, so we recommend you take the time to read them in full. There is no substitution for knowing your roots, or seeing how the branches grow today. Bush is writing as Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development at the end of WWII. His aim is to interrogate what all the scientists will do once the war is over. He urges scientists to take on the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. This is about a new relationship between thinking humans and the sum of what we know. He begins with an idea we will return to with Juan Benet: cooperation . \"The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership [...] They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.\" Free yourself to work together Pointing out that science has given us increased control over our environment, improved how we meet our basic needs, boosted health (mental and physical), extended lifespans, provided swift communications and allowed us to create a record of ideas that endures beyond any one individual life, Bush comes to the central problem we still face today: \"There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial [...] \"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record .\" This is Bush's central theme, and it is timeless. We discussed how the record we use for establishing our shared history and for recording our transactions became one and the same thing in 2009, but we have yet to attend to this central question: how can we best use it ? The technology of the 1940's was very different, and Bush spends much time discussing the rise of complex machinery with interchangeable parts which could serve reliably, then the advances in photography and facsimile transmission, followed by the advances in voice recording. He uses these to imagine a world where scientists walk around with a camera on their head, recording their observations (both verbal and visual) and storing these on microfilm , which is the core technology he uses to spool out the rest of his ideas. \"A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended , it must be stored , and above all it must be consulted .\" \"[Using microfilm] the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk [...] Compression is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it [...] Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm Britannica would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent.\" Section 4 is about mechanization of the repetitive processes of thought which, to Bush, includes advanced analysis because creative thinking is concerned only with the selection of data and the process to be employed. The manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence can be relegated to machines. Our technology must allow users \"to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules [...] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate figures [...] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed.\" Section 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives into the final and most critical part the human record: consultation . Selecting the trail \"We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This [...] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection , and here we are halting indeed [...] Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. \"[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [...] operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\" Bush introduces the \"memex\" - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording technologies, and associative selection. It won't be as fast or flexibile as the brain, but it could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall. \"This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.\" Bush is really talking about building \"user trails\" through these associative indices. In much the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails could also be shared: my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two. \"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [...] There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.\" Bush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human nervous system. He ends with this: \"[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.\" The mnemonic medium Media for thought are all around us: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. Media for thought create powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly impossible. Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further. \ud83d\udca1 If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free. \"Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: 'the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization' [...] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning.\" Leveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to remember what you've read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this context, it means adopting highly specialized flash cards in an essay, and spaced repetition (SRM) reminders after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer. Matuschak and Nielsen discuss many preliminary results and argue that though this may seem like \"just\" an essay with fancy flashcards, simple media can still be profound in their unexpected implications. Just look at writing. Or money. Why all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic. \"Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge [...] because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative . That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up.\" The key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a scalable memory laboratory which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning. \"We\u2019ll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [...] Seriously developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought.\" Network structures for knowledge Critically, memory systems need to ensure that people don't just learn surface features; they need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as carrying two texts: the actual one and the reflected one, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards. However, it is a mistake to think \"good memory system == spaced repetition\". There is also elaborative encoding and the sort of associative trails Bush was talking about; and techniques like the method of loci , though this isn't as useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge (esp. for novices). Seeing this broader perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like: \ud83d\udca1 What is the ideal network structure of knowledge? And what does memory have to do with understanding and creativity ? Conceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely automating away the problem of memory, the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get through. The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of chunking , as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970's. \"Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 patterns of chess pieces. These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players perceive as a unity, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces [...] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition.\" Of course, we still need to know what to memorize and what the impact of such media will really be on people's cognition and behaviour. My sense is that having transportable user trails , like Bush imagined in '45, would be extremely useful. How to make this wealth of knowledge easily shareable? Just encode them as 12-word mnemonics inside a world computer ... Designing insight Nielsen and Matuschak then discuss what it would have taken to get from Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numeral from a design perspective. \"The design and mathematical insights are inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa [... This is] a general truth: the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter [... Mnemonic media] will express deep original insights into memory [...] A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.\" This general truth reveals the deep difference between what Alan Kay called \"pop\" and \"research\" cultures. Pop culture is great at producing products we consume, but is insufficient for creating new tools for thought. \"The warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought [...] The aspiration is [...] to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of the modern research culture.\" \"This is not the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. New tools can lead to new subject matter insights for humanity as a whole , and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.\" \"Doing this is a cultural struggle. It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the insight-through-making loop working at full throttle [...] You have brilliant researchers who think of making as something essentially trivial, 'just a matter of implementation'. And you have makers who don\u2019t understand research, who see it as merely a slow and dysfunctional process.\" Extending our mnemonics The second half of the essay explores tools for thought more generally, starting with two videos well worth experiencing yourself. \"Watching this video is a remarkable emotional experience. It\u2019s obvious the person narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but empathize [...] It\u2019s tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it\u2019s the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action [...] \"Is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video \u2013 a range which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? [...] To create an integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience?\" We must take emotion as seriously as movie, music, and video game designers do. All of these people have elaborate models for emotional response, which we must also take into account if we are to augment our freedom to think with digital tools. Tools for thought are public goods. Thus they suffer from the same issues around funding and building the right kind of practices and processes required for real development. \"Consider our most fundamental tools for thought \u2013 language, writing, music, etc. Those are public goods [...] These tools all introduce fundamental new mental representations and operations. Those aren\u2019t owned by any company, they\u2019re patterns owned by humanity .\" \"We need to develop a powerful praxis, a set of core ideas which are explicit and powerful enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice.\" Why is it worthwhile devoting yourself to an open-ended endeavour like this which isn't as well-funded as many other sectors in tech? Well, because: \"The creation of language \u2013 the ur tool for thought \u2013 is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity\u2019s existence [...] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought \u2013 writing, the printing press, and so on \u2013 are among our greatest ever breakthroughs.\" What will new tools for thought really look like? Our contention is that protocols for money are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool. \"If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person\u2019s thinking, or even their consciousness .\" Executable books Let's go one step further, by considering an economic argument about what factors actually effect long-term wealth inequality (turns out it's not initial distribution, but the nature of transactions). Because this surprising result is arrived at computationally in an open-source Jupyter notebook , you can test it yourself, and are invited to find initial distributions which do effect long-term inequalities if you can. The authors call this \"Scaffolded exploration: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge. It\u2019s tempting to regard [Jupyter notebooks] as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they\u2019re a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further. \"There\u2019s a general principle here: good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems [...] Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers. They\u2019re not working on the problem for a paycheck; they\u2019re working on it because they desperately want to know the answer.\" The ultimate aspiration here is to develop canonical media in these new tools, like 2001: A Space Odyssey created for movies. Nielsen and Matuschak suggest that: \"One fun project would be to develop an executable form of the most recent IPCC climate assessment report. Instead of a report full of assertions and references, you\u2019d have a live climate model for people to explore. If it was good enough, people would teach classes from it; if it was really superb, not only would they teach classes from it, it could perhaps become the creative working environment for many climate scientists.\" The best example of this currently is The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics: \"Many theorems aren\u2019t just expressed in static form, on the page, but live, as code which can be modified by the user. Theorems become APIs, which can literally be applied to other objects, and chained together.

It's about building public tools for thought which - like language - are really patterns owned by humanity as a whole, in which we can playfully explore with each other the very edges of our shared record of knowledge, adding new pieces as scaffolding for those who follow to continue the fun.

The internet came with grand dreams, though we're mostly stuck with artificial social spaces, overwhelming algorithms, and extractive incentives which are mining our attention as a means of propping up a failing economy. These two essays draw out a common thread of thought stretched across 74 years in order to illustrate what sorts of freedom are actually on offer in this world wide web of ours. Since 1945, one critical feature has revolved around constructing new media for free and creative thought. At first it may seem unrelated to blockchains, but tools for thought are public goods and suffer from the same problem of incentives as all other public goods. They are thus the perfect example of paradigm shifts which require us to understand why programming regenerative incentives matters, and what economic code can really be used to achieve in the long-term. \"The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.\"","title":"How does this fit into KERNEL?"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#brief","text":"We'll be taking great liberties by summarizing these seminal essays extensively, so we recommend you take the time to read them in full. There is no substitution for knowing your roots, or seeing how the branches grow today. Bush is writing as Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development at the end of WWII. His aim is to interrogate what all the scientists will do once the war is over. He urges scientists to take on the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. This is about a new relationship between thinking humans and the sum of what we know. He begins with an idea we will return to with Juan Benet: cooperation . \"The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership [...] They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.\"","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#free-yourself-to-work-together","text":"Pointing out that science has given us increased control over our environment, improved how we meet our basic needs, boosted health (mental and physical), extended lifespans, provided swift communications and allowed us to create a record of ideas that endures beyond any one individual life, Bush comes to the central problem we still face today: \"There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial [...] \"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record .\" This is Bush's central theme, and it is timeless. We discussed how the record we use for establishing our shared history and for recording our transactions became one and the same thing in 2009, but we have yet to attend to this central question: how can we best use it ? The technology of the 1940's was very different, and Bush spends much time discussing the rise of complex machinery with interchangeable parts which could serve reliably, then the advances in photography and facsimile transmission, followed by the advances in voice recording. He uses these to imagine a world where scientists walk around with a camera on their head, recording their observations (both verbal and visual) and storing these on microfilm , which is the core technology he uses to spool out the rest of his ideas. \"A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended , it must be stored , and above all it must be consulted .\" \"[Using microfilm] the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk [...] Compression is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it [...] Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm Britannica would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent.\" Section 4 is about mechanization of the repetitive processes of thought which, to Bush, includes advanced analysis because creative thinking is concerned only with the selection of data and the process to be employed. The manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence can be relegated to machines. Our technology must allow users \"to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules [...] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate figures [...] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed.\" Section 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives into the final and most critical part the human record: consultation .","title":"Free yourself to work together"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#selecting-the-trail","text":"\"We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This [...] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection , and here we are halting indeed [...] Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. \"[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [...] operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\" Bush introduces the \"memex\" - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording technologies, and associative selection. It won't be as fast or flexibile as the brain, but it could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall. \"This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.\" Bush is really talking about building \"user trails\" through these associative indices. In much the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails could also be shared: my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two. \"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [...] There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.\" Bush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human nervous system. He ends with this: \"[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.\"","title":"Selecting the trail"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#the-mnemonic-medium","text":"Media for thought are all around us: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. Media for thought create powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly impossible. Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further. \ud83d\udca1 If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free. \"Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: 'the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization' [...] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning.\" Leveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to remember what you've read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this context, it means adopting highly specialized flash cards in an essay, and spaced repetition (SRM) reminders after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer. Matuschak and Nielsen discuss many preliminary results and argue that though this may seem like \"just\" an essay with fancy flashcards, simple media can still be profound in their unexpected implications. Just look at writing. Or money. Why all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic. \"Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge [...] because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative . That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up.\" The key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a scalable memory laboratory which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning. \"We\u2019ll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [...] Seriously developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought.\"","title":"The mnemonic medium"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#network-structures-for-knowledge","text":"Critically, memory systems need to ensure that people don't just learn surface features; they need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as carrying two texts: the actual one and the reflected one, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards. However, it is a mistake to think \"good memory system == spaced repetition\". There is also elaborative encoding and the sort of associative trails Bush was talking about; and techniques like the method of loci , though this isn't as useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge (esp. for novices). Seeing this broader perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like: \ud83d\udca1 What is the ideal network structure of knowledge? And what does memory have to do with understanding and creativity ? Conceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely automating away the problem of memory, the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get through. The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of chunking , as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970's. \"Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 patterns of chess pieces. These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players perceive as a unity, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces [...] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition.\" Of course, we still need to know what to memorize and what the impact of such media will really be on people's cognition and behaviour. My sense is that having transportable user trails , like Bush imagined in '45, would be extremely useful. How to make this wealth of knowledge easily shareable? Just encode them as 12-word mnemonics inside a world computer ...","title":"Network structures for knowledge"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#designing-insight","text":"Nielsen and Matuschak then discuss what it would have taken to get from Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numeral from a design perspective. \"The design and mathematical insights are inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa [... This is] a general truth: the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter [... Mnemonic media] will express deep original insights into memory [...] A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.\" This general truth reveals the deep difference between what Alan Kay called \"pop\" and \"research\" cultures. Pop culture is great at producing products we consume, but is insufficient for creating new tools for thought. \"The warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought [...] The aspiration is [...] to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of the modern research culture.\" \"This is not the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. New tools can lead to new subject matter insights for humanity as a whole , and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.\" \"Doing this is a cultural struggle. It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the insight-through-making loop working at full throttle [...] You have brilliant researchers who think of making as something essentially trivial, 'just a matter of implementation'.

But it\u2019s the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action [...] \"Is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video \u2013 a range which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? [...] To create an integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience?\" We must take emotion as seriously as movie, music, and video game designers do. All of these people have elaborate models for emotional response, which we must also take into account if we are to augment our freedom to think with digital tools. Tools for thought are public goods. Thus they suffer from the same issues around funding and building the right kind of practices and processes required for real development. \"Consider our most fundamental tools for thought \u2013 language, writing, music, etc. Those are public goods [...] These tools all introduce fundamental new mental representations and operations. Those aren\u2019t owned by any company, they\u2019re patterns owned by humanity .\" \"We need to develop a powerful praxis, a set of core ideas which are explicit and powerful enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice.\" Why is it worthwhile devoting yourself to an open-ended endeavour like this which isn't as well-funded as many other sectors in tech? Well, because: \"The creation of language \u2013 the ur tool for thought \u2013 is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity\u2019s existence [...] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought \u2013 writing, the printing press, and so on \u2013 are among our greatest ever breakthroughs.\" What will new tools for thought really look like? Our contention is that protocols for money are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool. \"If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person\u2019s thinking, or even their consciousness .\"","title":"Extending our mnemonics"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#executable-books","text":"Let's go one step further, by considering an economic argument about what factors actually effect long-term wealth inequality (turns out it's not initial distribution, but the nature of transactions).

The authors call this \"Scaffolded exploration: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge. It\u2019s tempting to regard [Jupyter notebooks] as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they\u2019re a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further. \"There\u2019s a general principle here: good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems [...] Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers.

Nielsen and Matuschak suggest that: \"One fun project would be to develop an executable form of the most recent IPCC climate assessment report. Instead of a report full of assertions and references, you\u2019d have a live climate model for people to explore.

Again","title":"References"},{"location":"module-3/time/","text":"\u231a The present time Let's take a deep breath and remember what reclaiming the web is all about: augmenting our ability to think freely for ourselves; creating time; and extending our ability to cooperate. There's no-one better than Douglas Rushkoff to present the second part of this for us: creating time. The presentation is summarized extensively below for those who apparently \"don't have the time\", and Rushkoff will show you how this attitude is a shortsighted way to live life which reveals basically everything wrong with the way we currently use the internet. Brief \"Slackers were a people of the early and mid-1980's who wanted to create more time to have fun and read and think [...] The net looked like this great way to create time . We were all gonna get to work at home, in our underwear, in our own time, and exchange and transact directly in some kind of an Etsy, Burning Man-like rave of culture and intellect. But something else happened on the way home from Wired magazine, which is that the internet instead became the poster child for the dying Nasdaq stock exchange and, as I see it, the dying industrial age economy. So, instead of using the net to create more time for people, we turned human attention into the next commodity.\" In the extractive perspective of corporate capitalism, human attention is an untapped resource. We were only spending 8 hours a day working and 2 hours consuming, so why not encourage us to spend 48-hours a day working, consuming, and socializing? This is possible if we break up our attention into four parallel tracks - all in the pursuit of \" mining time \". \"Instead of getting an internet which gave us more time to think; instead of getting an internet that worked not like a phone, but a properly asynchronous technology that would sit and wait until we were ready to deal with it; instead of having sequential conferences on bulletin boards like The Well where you would take hours to craft a response to something, we ended up with a digital space where we were constantly being interrupted [...] We end up in this state of constant emergency interruption which I don't think is healthy neurologically or culturally.\" What Rushkoff is exploring is whether the digital media environment is genuinely asynchronous. Here is the ultimate argument for \"bad blockchain UX\" . Maybe this is really our opportunity to build properly asynchronous experiences and train people to work and create in their own time , rather than something to be papered over as best we can with solutions that compromise the inherent properties of the protocols on which they build? \"Are we moving into a political landscape where we no longer have 'ends-justify-the-means', goal-orientated, future-based campaigns, but rather some kind of a presentist, process-orientated, consensus-building politic; more embodied by something like Occupy than it is by a two-party ideological debate?\" This was said in 2013, and has turned out not to be true. Yet. It is still a powerful question, the answer to which depends on whether you think the current political climate is a trend, or a temporary reaction against the trend. \"Finally, are the folks who should be helping us think about this instead just taking a very 20 th Century, almost Biblical, template and superimposing it on this presentist world we're living in? In other words, are they so intolerant of a world that doesn't have a defined conclusion; which doesn't have a goal; in which we're not leading towards some climax, that they overlay this bizarre notion of a singularity?\" Rushkoff went on to extend these ideas in Team Human , which is another fantastic read for any budding media theorist. His voice is a critical counterpoint to SV singularity worship. \"The book is a humanist work, and I'm declaring myself with Jaron Lanier and other humanists. I do believe there is something special about people that we don't quite understand and that our efforts to upload ourselves or simulate our realities will fall short of what it actually is to be human. Our best defense against present shock is to be in the genuine present .\" This is a spiritual statement, and it may seem that the ultimate end of both Rushkoff's work and The Age of Spiritual Machines and all the 'bizarre singularity stuff' is one and the same. However, there is a critical difference: Rushkoff is saying we, us messy human beings, have to find our own way into the genuine present. Kurzweil is saying that the machines will do it for us. Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle? Conspiring against the actual OS \"It does require still being together , looking another person in the eye, learning how to breathe together. Conspire : literally, 'breathe together'. It requires us to see how human environments empower us against abstract entities which depend on our isolation and alienation [...] This local, body-based sensibility is the thing which can bring us to understand the kinds of time that can't be measure on a clock or a calendar or a computer. The underlying human rhythms.\" This is followed by a question about where exactly between Kurzweil and Lanier we can locate Rushkoff's ideas, to which he replies: \"I love digital technology, I just think we're misapplying it when we use it to amplify the obsolete agenda of a 13 th Century economic operating system. There was an emerging, peer-to-peer economic landscape in the 11 th and 12 th Centuries in Europe, through which people were developing local currencies and trading in local bazaars, and we had the rise of a middle class like we've never seen in history.\" The feudal lords were not included in this wealth creation, so they made it illegal through charter monopolies. Therefore, instead of creating, we had to get jobs. Instead of being paid for what we made, we got paid for the time we worked. It was a temporal shift . The invention of the clock and a specific kind of sovereign currency are co-incidental, not coincidence. This works as long as the economy expands, because more money must be paid back than is lent out - a feature which led to the perverse growth mindset we still suffer from today. Critically, new kinds of economic systems, if engineered well, could free us from industrial-age clocks and allow us to adopt a different kind of temporal landscape, which means a different kind of money and transaction that is \"much more real-time based, rather than being biased to storage and saving over time, or both .\" We know from Andreas that engineering both is an actual possibility currently underway. \"We could have transactions that are earned into existence.\" It's bold because it's important. Peer-to-peer, electronic payment systems are not about debt vs ownership. They are about earnings based on time vs earnings based on creativity. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on this statement. \"The problem with technologists who disrupt any given industry is that, once they've done that, they go back to Goldman and ask for a Series B. They're not willing to undermine the operating system that they're sitting on top of [...] What I want them to do is break that OS, or challenge it, or come up with an alternative. Why do you need to go back to corporate capital and put the clock back into businesses that weren't on it!?\" This moves into a discussion about old industries being disrupted by networked services which didn't even intend to do so. Rushkoff argues that many internet-age services - like Pandora - are locally disruptive, but then turn to the NYSE to get funded and so fail to challenge the real paradigm they ought to be disrupting. Media Environments \"I don't mean peer-to-peer sharing of Sony music. I mean peer-to-peer sharing of music that we make . This would create a different kind of social marketplace that would allow music - not to get New Age - to retrieve some of its sacred value as opposed to its monetary value. And why is it OK that it retrieves some sacred value? Because it turns out that we don't really need everybody making money, because we don't really need to get to full employment, because we don't all really need jobs, because we have more than enough stuff already.\" This is also critical: jobs are not the problem . I don't want a job - I want my basic needs fulfilled and a degree of comfort and security which will enable me to make a meaningful contribution. Jobs are an artifact of the industrial age and a certain way of existing in time. \"What I am looking at in Present Shock is what McLuhan called the difference in media environments created by different technologies. The invention of text is what put us in time to begin with. With text, we got accountability [...] With text we got a religion that was based on accountability: it was a covenant, a contract with God [...] We get moschiach , we get messiah, we get the calendar, we get the past and future, we get laws, we get sabbath. With the clock, we get the industrial age, we get efficiency [...] we get interest-based currency and the idea of trying to do more in less. We get a time-is-money, efficiency-based culture.\" Time is not money. Time is time, and making money into an open protocol that anyone can access gives us the opportunity to free value from its dependence on transient expression. Rushkoff describes the move from a sweeping second hand to a digital clock, with the effect it had on our media environment. It replaced story cycles with sequential movement. In a world of remote controls and DVRs and asynchronous behaviour, the great narrative arcs which have held culture together until now no longer function. \"We don't care if Homer gets out the power plant before it blows up; we care about what scene is being satired, what connections we can make, how this is going meta on that and then meta on this and so on [...] It's a very different, presentist approach to problems where we move through media much more like a video game: in real-time, first-person, choice to choice.\" The conversation moves into a description of \"presentist\" narratives and the further breaking down of this single crisis-climax-sleep, hero's journey arc typical of Western culture into something more like a role-playing video game, where we \"Uncover reality, rather than move through a singular narrative [...] It ends up much more fractal! It turns out we don't have to have an end to reality.\" Questions? At 43 minutes, we move into the Q A section. The first question asks if this is a novel problem because, for instance, Buddhism can be seen as a system for dealing with present shock and pulling you deeply into the now. To which Rushkoff answers: \"The problem has been around forever, but the form of distraction from the present changes.\" He describes chronos (clock time) and kairos (human time, timing). Each invention - text, the clock, digital technology - takes us out of kairos and into chronos and, in each case, the answer is the same: to fall back into the present and to be here now . But the trick to being here now in an industrial era is different than the trick to being here now in a digital era. The second question is about using technology to enhance creativity. \"We all know two kids with a laptop can create an application that changes the world. The problem is: how do you help them see that the first thing to do after they get some success and traction is not to sell it to people who will use it against it's original purposes [...] That is: it's OK to have a business which 'just' supports its employees and users.\" A question about cultural preservation comes next, not relevant to this brief. Then a question about our inability to be totally locally reliant - i.e. you cannot make your phone yourself, you rely on a complex global supply chain. Rushkoff acknowledges this and replies: \"Hopefully, we'll get complex technological goods from a complex global economy, and food human goods from a local economy. Which means we'll need more than one kind of currency.\" Why does the currency matter so much? \"If you're using a bank-issued currency, then it has to be loaned into existence and requires payback. Also, if you're using a centrally-issued currency, than Walmart will have an advantage over local business. The only advantage local business is going to have over big global business - because money is more expensive for local businesses - is if the local business starts with local re-investments in itself [...] \"In all of these things, we're looking at a new balance between your hard drive and RAM. We've been in a hard drive society for a long, long time and it's all about storage. We're moving into RAM, as individuals too: much more present-based access to memory as opposed to just hoarding stuff [...] We can balance some of the ills of long distance economic activity with a few mechanisms to help local economic activity compete effectively. If we are in a free market economy, we should have free market currencies. \" Is kickstarter a viable alternative for people who don't want to get funded by corporate capital? Also, what about Bitcoin? \"Kickstarter is much more real-time: you're matching supply and demand instead of having a capitalist speculate on future value [As for Bitcoin], I'm not looking at a currency that you're trying to hoard; you're not investing in a currency, but rather using a currency merely to promote transactions so that you can get the stuff you want and do the stuff you want.\" How can we read the humanism Rushkoff is arguing for in the context of Bitcoin? What is the effect of humans interfacing with inanimate objects - does it lead to the presentism and present shock he's talking about? \"Present shock is our initial wobble at moving from a linear-time-based society to this digital, choice-based, highly interruptive society [...] Presentism is really the ability to embrace and survive and reclaim our humanity on this landscape. Any technology only helps us reclaim our humanity insofar as it helps us create time to be with other people . It's the face-to-face, real-time human interaction that matters. And the more you do that - and this starts to get out there - the less money even needs to be a part of the equation .\" \ud83d\udca1 Imagine we used open protocols for money to ensure that no-one ever *needs* money again? That would be a true redefinition of wealth. That would be a story worth writing home about. \"The monies we have now don't allow for that. They're not supposed to. They're part of a system through which we've been taught not to trust each other, not to transact. We've been taught that money is a cleaner way to engage. Hopefully, we'll start to trust each other more than the stuff.\" Of course, it might take multiple global crises to get people to this point, but living in hope remains - at the least - a better psychological attitude than living in despair. \"It's just a matter of creating balance between the sense of infinite connections and the sense of holism. It's the same challenge you find at any level: take groups and individuals. If you over-identify with the group, you lose yourself; if you over-identify with yourself, you lose community. It's just something we have to be conscious of now if we're going to remain coherent.\"","title":"Time"},{"location":"module-3/time/#the-present-time","text":"Let's take a deep breath and remember what reclaiming the web is all about: augmenting our ability to think freely for ourselves; creating time; and extending our ability to cooperate. There's no-one better than Douglas Rushkoff to present the second part of this for us: creating time. The presentation is summarized extensively below for those who apparently \"don't have the time\", and Rushkoff will show you how this attitude is a shortsighted way to live life which reveals basically everything wrong with the way we currently use the internet.","title":"\u231a The present time"},{"location":"module-3/time/#brief","text":"\"Slackers were a people of the early and mid-1980's who wanted to create more time to have fun and read and think [...] The net looked like this great way to create time . We were all gonna get to work at home, in our underwear, in our own time, and exchange and transact directly in some kind of an Etsy, Burning Man-like rave of culture and intellect. But something else happened on the way home from Wired magazine, which is that the internet instead became the poster child for the dying Nasdaq stock exchange and, as I see it, the dying industrial age economy. So, instead of using the net to create more time for people, we turned human attention into the next commodity.\" In the extractive perspective of corporate capitalism, human attention is an untapped resource. We were only spending 8 hours a day working and 2 hours consuming, so why not encourage us to spend 48-hours a day working, consuming, and socializing? This is possible if we break up our attention into four parallel tracks - all in the pursuit of \" mining time \". \"Instead of getting an internet which gave us more time to think; instead of getting an internet that worked not like a phone, but a properly asynchronous technology that would sit and wait until we were ready to deal with it; instead of having sequential conferences on bulletin boards like The Well where you would take hours to craft a response to something, we ended up with a digital space where we were constantly being interrupted [...] We end up in this state of constant emergency interruption which I don't think is healthy neurologically or culturally.\" What Rushkoff is exploring is whether the digital media environment is genuinely asynchronous. Here is the ultimate argument for \"bad blockchain UX\" . Maybe this is really our opportunity to build properly asynchronous experiences and train people to work and create in their own time , rather than something to be papered over as best we can with solutions that compromise the inherent properties of the protocols on which they build? \"Are we moving into a political landscape where we no longer have 'ends-justify-the-means', goal-orientated, future-based campaigns, but rather some kind of a presentist, process-orientated, consensus-building politic; more embodied by something like Occupy than it is by a two-party ideological debate?\" This was said in 2013, and has turned out not to be true. Yet. It is still a powerful question, the answer to which depends on whether you think the current political climate is a trend, or a temporary reaction against the trend. \"Finally, are the folks who should be helping us think about this instead just taking a very 20 th Century, almost Biblical, template and superimposing it on this presentist world we're living in? In other words, are they so intolerant of a world that doesn't have a defined conclusion; which doesn't have a goal; in which we're not leading towards some climax, that they overlay this bizarre notion of a singularity?\" Rushkoff went on to extend these ideas in Team Human , which is another fantastic read for any budding media theorist. His voice is a critical counterpoint to SV singularity worship. \"The book is a humanist work, and I'm declaring myself with Jaron Lanier and other humanists. I do believe there is something special about people that we don't quite understand and that our efforts to upload ourselves or simulate our realities will fall short of what it actually is to be human. Our best defense against present shock is to be in the genuine present .\" This is a spiritual statement, and it may seem that the ultimate end of both Rushkoff's work and The Age of Spiritual Machines and all the 'bizarre singularity stuff' is one and the same. However, there is a critical difference: Rushkoff is saying we, us messy human beings, have to find our own way into the genuine present. Kurzweil is saying that the machines will do it for us. Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle?","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-3/time/#conspiring-against-the-actual-os","text":"\"It does require still being together , looking another person in the eye, learning how to breathe together. Conspire : literally, 'breathe together'. It requires us to see how human environments empower us against abstract entities which depend on our isolation and alienation [...] This local, body-based sensibility is the thing which can bring us to understand the kinds of time that can't be measure on a clock or a calendar or a computer. The underlying human rhythms.\" This is followed by a question about where exactly between Kurzweil and Lanier we can locate Rushkoff's ideas, to which he replies: \"I love digital technology, I just think we're misapplying it when we use it to amplify the obsolete agenda of a 13 th Century economic operating system. There was an emerging, peer-to-peer economic landscape in the 11 th and 12 th Centuries in Europe, through which people were developing local currencies and trading in local bazaars, and we had the rise of a middle class like we've never seen in history.\" The feudal lords were not included in this wealth creation, so they made it illegal through charter monopolies. Therefore, instead of creating, we had to get jobs. Instead of being paid for what we made, we got paid for the time we worked. It was a temporal shift . The invention of the clock and a specific kind of sovereign currency are co-incidental, not coincidence. This works as long as the economy expands, because more money must be paid back than is lent out - a feature which led to the perverse growth mindset we still suffer from today. Critically, new kinds of economic systems, if engineered well, could free us from industrial-age clocks and allow us to adopt a different kind of temporal landscape, which means a different kind of money and transaction that is \"much more real-time based, rather than being biased to storage and saving over time, or both .\" We know from Andreas that engineering both is an actual possibility currently underway. \"We could have transactions that are earned into existence.\" It's bold because it's important. Peer-to-peer, electronic payment systems are not about debt vs ownership. They are about earnings based on time vs earnings based on creativity. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on this statement. \"The problem with technologists who disrupt any given industry is that, once they've done that, they go back to Goldman and ask for a Series B. They're not willing to undermine the operating system that they're sitting on top of [...] What I want them to do is break that OS, or challenge it, or come up with an alternative. Why do you need to go back to corporate capital and put the clock back into businesses that weren't on it!?\" This moves into a discussion about old industries being disrupted by networked services which didn't even intend to do so. Rushkoff argues that many internet-age services - like Pandora - are locally disruptive, but then turn to the NYSE to get funded and so fail to challenge the real paradigm they ought to be disrupting.","title":"Conspiring against the actual OS"},{"location":"module-3/time/#media-environments","text":"\"I don't mean peer-to-peer sharing of Sony music. I mean peer-to-peer sharing of music that we make . This would create a different kind of social marketplace that would allow music - not to get New Age - to retrieve some of its sacred value as opposed to its monetary value. And why is it OK that it retrieves some sacred value? Because it turns out that we don't really need everybody making money, because we don't really need to get to full employment, because we don't all really need jobs, because we have more than enough stuff already.\" This is also critical: jobs are not the problem . I don't want a job - I want my basic needs fulfilled and a degree of comfort and security which will enable me to make a meaningful contribution. Jobs are an artifact of the industrial age and a certain way of existing in time. \"What I am looking at in Present Shock is what McLuhan called the difference in media environments created by different technologies. The invention of text is what put us in time to begin with. With text, we got accountability [...] With text we got a religion that was based on accountability: it was a covenant, a contract with God [...] We get moschiach , we get messiah, we get the calendar, we get the past and future, we get laws, we get sabbath. With the clock, we get the industrial age, we get efficiency [...] we get interest-based currency and the idea of trying to do more in less. We get a time-is-money, efficiency-based culture.\" Time is not money. Time is time, and making money into an open protocol that anyone can access gives us the opportunity to free value from its dependence on transient expression. Rushkoff describes the move from a sweeping second hand to a digital clock, with the effect it had on our media environment. It replaced story cycles with sequential movement. In a world of remote controls and DVRs and asynchronous behaviour, the great narrative arcs which have held culture together until now no longer function. \"We don't care if Homer gets out the power plant before it blows up; we care about what scene is being satired, what connections we can make, how this is going meta on that and then meta on this and so on [...] It's a very different, presentist approach to problems where we move through media much more like a video game: in real-time, first-person, choice to choice.\" The conversation moves into a description of \"presentist\" narratives and the further breaking down of this single crisis-climax-sleep, hero's journey arc typical of Western culture into something more like a role-playing video game, where we \"Uncover reality, rather than move through a singular narrative [...] It ends up much more fractal! It turns out we don't have to have an end to reality.\"","title":"Media Environments"},{"location":"module-3/time/#questions","text":"At 43 minutes, we move into the Q A section. The first question asks if this is a novel problem because, for instance, Buddhism can be seen as a system for dealing with present shock and pulling you deeply into the now. To which Rushkoff answers: \"The problem has been around forever, but the form of distraction from the present changes.\" He describes chronos (clock time) and kairos (human time, timing). Each invention - text, the clock, digital technology - takes us out of kairos and into chronos and, in each case, the answer is the same: to fall back into the present and to be here now . But the trick to being here now in an industrial era is different than the trick to being here now in a digital era. The second question is about using technology to enhance creativity. \"We all know two kids with a laptop can create an application that changes the world. The problem is: how do you help them see that the first thing to do after they get some success and traction is not to sell it to people who will use it against it's original purposes [...] That is: it's OK to have a business which 'just' supports its employees and users.\" A question about cultural preservation comes next, not relevant to this brief. Then a question about our inability to be totally locally reliant - i.e. you cannot make your phone yourself, you rely on a complex global supply chain. Rushkoff acknowledges this and replies: \"Hopefully, we'll get complex technological goods from a complex global economy, and food human goods from a local economy. Which means we'll need more than one kind of currency.\" Why does the currency matter so much? \"If you're using a bank-issued currency, then it has to be loaned into existence and requires payback. Also, if you're using a centrally-issued currency, than Walmart will have an advantage over local business. The only advantage local business is going to have over big global business - because money is more expensive for local businesses - is if the local business starts with local re-investments in itself [...] \"In all of these things, we're looking at a new balance between your hard drive and RAM. We've been in a hard drive society for a long, long time and it's all about storage. We're moving into RAM, as individuals too: much more present-based access to memory as opposed to just hoarding stuff [...] We can balance some of the ills of long distance economic activity with a few mechanisms to help local economic activity compete effectively. If we are in a free market economy, we should have free market currencies. \" Is kickstarter a viable alternative for people who don't want to get funded by corporate capital? Also, what about Bitcoin? \"Kickstarter is much more real-time: you're matching supply and demand instead of having a capitalist speculate on future value [As for Bitcoin], I'm not looking at a currency that you're trying to hoard; you're not investing in a currency, but rather using a currency merely to promote transactions so that you can get the stuff you want and do the stuff you want.\" How can we read the humanism Rushkoff is arguing for in the context of Bitcoin? What is the effect of humans interfacing with inanimate objects - does it lead to the presentism and present shock he's talking about? \"Present shock is our initial wobble at moving from a linear-time-based society to this digital, choice-based, highly interruptive society [...] Presentism is really the ability to embrace and survive and reclaim our humanity on this landscape. Any technology only helps us reclaim our humanity insofar as it helps us create time to be with other people . It's the face-to-face, real-time human interaction that matters. And the more you do that - and this starts to get out there - the less money even needs to be a part of the equation .\" \ud83d\udca1 Imagine we used open protocols for money to ensure that no-one ever *needs* money again?

In order to understand our roots, we turn to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and a governance document they ratified in 1992, just as the web was really getting going. In order to move through it's most modern branches, we'll turn to Venkatesh Rao and James Scott. Rough Consensus and Running Code Governing Legibility Chaos How does this fit into KERNEL? \"It is easier to comprehend the whole by walking among the trees and becoming a holographic, fractal part of the forest, than by hovering above it.\" Brief IETF governance revolves around the simple maxim that engineering is about trade-offs . As such, we need clear ways of thinking about how we make decisions. We ought to avoid \"majority rule\" and get to rough consensus decisions which promote the best technical outcomes. Rough consensus is therefore a sort of \"exception processing\", meant to deal with cases where the person objecting still feels strongly that their objection is valid and must be accommodated. Balloting or looking at percentages cannot \"determine\" consensus in such cases. Minority views must be addressed, with justification . Simply having a large majority of people agreeing to dismiss an objection is not enough to claim there is rough consensus; the group must have honestly considered the objection and addressed fully all technical issues. In a different article , Venkatesh Rao discusses how: \"Rough consensus is about finding the most fertile directions in which to proceed rather than uncovering constraints. Constraints in software tend to be relatively few and obvious. Possibilities, however, tend to be intimidatingly vast. Resisting limiting visions, finding the most fertile direction, and allying with the right people become the primary challenges.\" As with our own play of thinking patterns , the IETF addresses these challenges in the negative. They consider issues first rather than agreements; address them but don\u2019t accommodate them; and understand (through iterative practice) that consensus is a tool and not a destination. 1. Lack of disagreement is more important than agreement Determining consensus and coming to consensus are different to having consensus. In determining consensus, the key is to separate those choices that are simply unappealing from those that are truly problematic. Closure is more likely to be achieved quickly by asking for objections rather than agreement. 1a. The two meanings of \"compromise\" Among engineering choices , compromises are expected and essential. We must weigh trade-offs and collectively choose the set that best meets the full set of requirements. Among people , far less so. Such compromises occur when one group has given up trying to appease the others. Conceding when there is an outstanding technical objection is not coming to consensus. Even worse is horse-trading: \"I object to your proposal for such-and-so reasons. You object to my proposal for this-and-that reason. Neither of us agree. If you stop objecting to my proposal, I'll stop objecting to your proposal and we'll put them both in.\" 2. Issues are addressed, not necessarily accommodated \"That's not my favorite solution, but I can live with it. We've made a reasonable choice\" - this is consensus, not rough. It\u2019s only rough when an unsatisfied person still has an open issue, but the group has truly answered the objection at a technical level. This relies on the good judgement of the consensus caller , or chair. Finding \u201crough consensus\u201d means that not only has the working group taken the objection seriously, but that it has fully examined the ramifications of not making a change to accommodate it, and that the outcome does not constitute a failure to meet the technical requirements of the work. What can't happen is that the chair bases their decision solely on hearing a large number of voices saying, \"The objection isn't valid.\" That would simply be to take a vote. A valid justification needs to be made . 3. Humming, not voting We don't vote because we can't vote. The IETF is not a membership organization, it's nearly impossible to figure out who would get a vote for any given question. There are only \u201cparticipants\u201d, not \u201cmembers\u201d. One reason for humming is pragmatic: to find a starting place for the conversation. A hum can indicate that there were less objections to A than to B at the beginning of the discussion, so starting with the objections to A might shorten the discussion. Another is to \"take the temperature\". A smaller bunch of loud hums for choice A and a larger number of non-committal hums for choice B might indicate that some believe that there are serious problems with choice B, albeit the more popular by sheer number of people. There is deep symbolism here: a show of hands might leave the impression that the number of people matters in some formal way. It doesn\u2019t . The formulation and order of questions asked can have huge effects on the outcome. Asking, \"Who supports going forward with this proposal?\", and asking it first, can cause more people to hum in the affirmative than would for differently formulated questions, or asking the same question after some more \"negatively\" framed questions. Any sort of polling must aim to prompt discussion and questions, not conclude the matter . 4. Consensus is the path, not the destination Consensus is a tool to ensure we get to the best technical outcomes. Experience has shown us that traditional voting leads to gaming of the system; \"compromises\" of the wrong sort; important minority views being ignored; and worse technical outcomes. Again, you cannot confirm that there is consensus by counting people, it must be about the outstanding issues and whether they have been addressed. 4a. One hundred people for and five people against might not be rough consensus If there is a minority who have a valid technical objection, that objection must be dealt with before consensus can be declared. This rules out vote stuffing. It's the existence of an unaddressed open issue, not the number of people, which determines consensus. As above, you can have rough consensus with issues that have been purposely dismissed, but not ones that have been ignored. 4b. Five people for and one hundred people against might still be rough consensus This is the most controversial result. It generally occurs in the case of small, active working groups where an objector recruits many otherwise silent participants to their cause. The principle is still the same: If the objection has been addressed, and the new voices are not giving informed responses to that point, it can still justifiably be called rough consensus. Sometimes, a show of hands can be useful; sometimes, it can be damaging and result in sub-optimal decisions. Sometimes, using a device like a \"hum\" can avoid those pitfalls; sometimes, it is just a poorly disguised vote. The objective nevertheless remains to protect against simple \u201cmajority rule\u201d and get to the best technical outcomes. The 2020 Take Most of this is still relevant 28 years later, though there are two points that stand out: this idea of a \"consensus caller\" or chair, and the strange concept of humming. In remote working environments there is no easy way to replicate humming. Nevertheless, it indicates two critical ideas for technical governance systems: voting ought to be about finding useful starting places for generative discussion, not reaching conclusions; and sheer number of people or votes does not determine consensus . That said, sentiment analysis of memes on sovereign social media could serve as a modern means of \"humming\". Memetic influence also addresses the issue of a \"chair\", which we do not - and should not - have in decentralized, community-run protocols. While there is no formal position, it is also undeniable that reputation gives certain individuals the power to shift conversations radically. Unfortunately, it's exactly the authority conferred by the formal position of \"chair\" which gives such individuals the power to get work done once all technical objections have been addressed. In place of this, we must turn to economics. If we combine delegated voting with algorithms like SourceCred, we can determine quality objections and rebuttals more easily. If we then plug this into non-linear funding mechanisms, which also act as on-chain economic signals of support - as we saw with EIP-1559 - we can determine collectively the best technical outcomes. Funded code running consensus EIP-1559 points at something deeper, which is also the reason that the previous paragraph is unnecessarily complicated. We were trying to replicate the IETF process, without acknowledging that, in 1992, there were sufficiently few people and resources online that it made sense we all came to at least rough consensus. Forking the internet in the 90's was not an option. If the ways in which we signal preference leads to an economic consensus that is strong enough to fund a given project, then we should not build governance systems that stand in the way. It sounds great to \"address all technical objections\" but - in practice - there are often so many variables at play that doing so in a truly neutral manner is impossible. Cost, however, is a single variable we can all reason about to at least a first approximation. Rough consensus is just \"exception processing\" for people. When your running code already establishes economic consensus, you can leverage this to fund multiple different working groups with multiple approaches, removing the need to handle exceptions at the initial stage because you know it will be decided by actual use later on. \"In other words, true north in software is often the direction that combines ambiguity and evidence of fertility in the most alluring way: the direction of maximal interestingness.\" Legibility We tend to reject \"rough\" systems and opt for more orderly approaches. It was precisely this tendency - arising from the anxiety produced by ambiguity - which prompted Pete Resnick to write the above article. And now, we're saying it's not even about rough consensus. It's about however many projects can garner sufficient support because, in open protocols for money, a \"vote\" is a economic signal which can simultaneously be used to fund what is being voted on. If you're objecting to the inevitable chaos of such an approach, it's time to talk about legibility. James Scott's book, Seeing Like A State , describes how modern states reorganized societies to make them more legible to the apparatus of governance. As Rao describes it: \"The state is not actually interested in the rich functional structure and complex behavior of the very organic entities that it governs. It merely views them as resources that must be organized in order to yield optimal returns. Importantly, this happens on both left and right: the failure mode is ideology-neutral: it arises from a flawed pattern of reasoning rather than values . \"This style of thinking leads to simplification, since a reality that serves many purposes presents itself as illegible to a vision informed by a singular purpose [...] The deep failure in thinking lies is the mistaken assumption that thriving, successful and functional realities must necessarily be legible.\" Don't misunderstand: there is - as always - a trade-off between \"simple to understand\" and \"functionally useful\", and there are some cases in which the first is genuinely useful. For instance: \"The bewilderingly illegible geography of time in the 18 th century, while it served a lot of local purposes, would have made modern global infrastructure, from the railroads (the original driver for temporal discipline in the United States) to airlines and the Internet, impossible.\" We can learn a great deal from the history of states and the very human desire for legibility. It does, in some instances, lead to improvement. For instance, we should learn from the IETF that: Closure is more likely to be achieved quickly by asking for objections rather than agreement. We should compromise between engineering choices, but not between people. We must address issues and justify technical choices to the greatest extent possible. Majority rule sucks. We must use consensus as a tool, not an end. We must build principled systems which cultivate our ability to make optimal collective choices. That said, we no longer operate in a version of the internet where rough consensus about a single way forward is even possible, let alone desirable. We need to embrace the generative chaos and use economic code which establishes consensus to fund as many different approaches as is appropriate, without treating humans as exceptions to be handled. \"Reformers do not acknowledge (and often do not understand) that they are engineering a shift in optima and power, with benefits AND costs. Instead, the process is driven by a naive 'best for everybody' paternalism, that genuinely intends to improve the lives of the people it affects.\" Don't be a reformer.

As such, we need clear ways of thinking about how we make decisions. We ought to avoid \"majority rule\" and get to rough consensus decisions which promote the best technical outcomes. Rough consensus is therefore a sort of \"exception processing\", meant to deal with cases where the person objecting still feels strongly that their objection is valid and must be accommodated. Balloting or looking at percentages cannot \"determine\" consensus in such cases. Minority views must be addressed, with justification . Simply having a large majority of people agreeing to dismiss an objection is not enough to claim there is rough consensus; the group must have honestly considered the objection and addressed fully all technical issues. In a different article , Venkatesh Rao discusses how: \"Rough consensus is about finding the most fertile directions in which to proceed rather than uncovering constraints. Constraints in software tend to be relatively few and obvious. Possibilities, however, tend to be intimidatingly vast. Resisting limiting visions, finding the most fertile direction, and allying with the right people become the primary challenges.\" As with our own play of thinking patterns , the IETF addresses these challenges in the negative.

Even worse is horse-trading: \"I object to your proposal for such-and-so reasons. You object to my proposal for this-and-that reason. Neither of us agree.

This relies on the good judgement of the consensus caller , or chair. Finding \u201crough consensus\u201d means that not only has the working group taken the objection seriously, but that it has fully examined the ramifications of not making a change to accommodate it, and that the outcome does not constitute a failure to meet the technical requirements of the work.

One reason for humming is pragmatic: to find a starting place for the conversation. A hum can indicate that there were less objections to A than to B at the beginning of the discussion, so starting with the objections to A might shorten the discussion. Another is to \"take the temperature\". A smaller bunch of loud hums for choice A and a larger number of non-committal hums for choice B might indicate that some believe that there are serious problems with choice B, albeit the more popular by sheer number of people. There is deep symbolism here: a show of hands might leave the impression that the number of people matters in some formal way. It doesn\u2019t . The formulation and order of questions asked can have huge effects on the outcome. Asking, \"Who supports going forward with this proposal?\", and asking it first, can cause more people to hum in the affirmative than would for differently formulated questions, or asking the same question after some more \"negatively\" framed questions.

Sometimes, a show of hands can be useful; sometimes, it can be damaging and result in sub-optimal decisions.

That said, sentiment analysis of memes on sovereign social media could serve as a modern means of \"humming\". Memetic influence also addresses the issue of a \"chair\", which we do not - and should not - have in decentralized, community-run protocols. While there is no formal position, it is also undeniable that reputation gives certain individuals the power to shift conversations radically. Unfortunately, it's exactly the authority conferred by the formal position of \"chair\" which gives such individuals the power to get work done once all technical objections have been addressed. In place of this, we must turn to economics. If we combine delegated voting with algorithms like SourceCred, we can determine quality objections and rebuttals more easily.

He outlines the basic problem in a way which should be deeply familiar by now: \"The case that I\u2019m going to make is that the identity debate is magnetically drawn to two opposing poles: Humans as things identified by their bodies, vs Humans as intangible, ever-shifting narrative beings \"Our job, as software engineers working on identity, is first to be philosophers who understand the abstraction that we hope to represent.\" He goes on to discuss experiments like the Enlightenment Intensive and their ancient correlates in traditions like Zen Buddhism in order to illustrate the point that: \"Identity is a deeply secret and mysterious thing for us, and staring right at it for long periods of time is the lifestyle preference of poets, saints, and madmen [...] They\u2019re things we do, or conditions we experience, relationships we participate in, but the sum of all the roles we play seems to fall short of describing the totality of our identity. Even when all the parts are put together, there is something indescribable in the whole.\" This is great for philosophers, poets, and madmen, but what about the poor software developers on this course?! \"For now, let\u2019s assume that software isn\u2019t going to help us much with metaphysical or deep psychological models of our identity. What are the areas where software is doing a good job of describing identity? Let's look at four cases:\" Credit Ratings - sum up huge amounts of information about your financial (and perhaps social) behavior, and reduce it to a number which estimates risk of default. The problem is that in any model of \u201cpeople like you,\u201d every data point is a cultural decision about whether, for this person, the value is True or False. So we must ask: is information about \u201cpeople like you\u201d also information about you, or is it simply an accumulated stereotype? Social Networks - i.e. the maps of who we read, write messages to, and consider ourselves kin to. The ghostly spirits of these micro-societies inform important parts of our identity and allow us to have conversations not otherwise possible: \"there are things I will simply never hear myself say except as part of a discussion with those little square faces.\" Which is strange, because this \"intersubjectivity exists inside of a platform that I have very little control of. It feels like a piece of my identity which is held hostage and at risk: if Twitter goes away, a piece of my political voice ceases to exist.\" Names - \" Documentally is a good example, in that people use his given name with a certain strangeness, a sense of referring to something not quite for public use. The man and the brand are interpenetrated.\" Vinay goes on to talk about the brand of Linus says... and the effect it's had on software development. \"A collection of identities more or less like Linus more or less run the internet \u2014 systems like the IETF probably could not function without the tools that support these blended representations of identity and authority.\" Surveillance Databases - \"What\u2019s interesting about this version of our identity, apart from its completeness, is that we \u2014 the subject \u2014 cannot see it. We can infer from the Snowden revelations that the national security databases have access to most or all of our social media, web surfing habits, financial and health records and more [...] This is an identity not made of what we know, but of what others know about us.\" These all frame deep questions about how, when and why identity and software intersect. Is information about you, which you have no access or control over, part of your identity? Or is that information somebody else\u2019s story? How does unconscious knowledge about us and our behavior factor into our identity? There are lots of things that we do not know about ourselves, but that others know about us, that are clearly parts of our identity from their perspective, but outside of our awareness. The algorithms used to cluster people by modern institutions actually create large parts of the \u201cidentity\u201d which is being stored about us. The art of the possible This might seem like a giant ontological mess - and it is - but \"if we understand that identity is a set of narratives that rely on culture to be effective, we can talk about what narratives are useful and reliable, and try to construct purpose built ones that help us relate to strangers and make the queues at airport immigration move more quickly.\" To construct the beginning of such a narrative, Vinay asks what is simple and clear in the identity space, and considers the limited attributes we have at birth. The first attributes we are given by others in the modern world generally make up our medical history and the \"attribute-free happy child becomes wrapped up in an entire world of data, identity, relationship and rights. None of this is endogenous \u2014 our baby has not generated all of these relationships, data and identities by will.\" While this may seem problematic, the system often saves lives based on such data-wrapping, and Vinay notes that as unsatisfying as \u201cidentity\u201d might be conceptually, there is no denying that in a variety of critical places, the current identity infrastructure works . He then discusses the origins of identity as a username-password combination. This worked well in the early days of the internet when there was a clear chain of accountability, but fell apart during the Eternal September . The critical point in this section revolves around accountability - a concept we don't pay nearly enough attention to online. \"The result of this breakdown in accountability (a breakdown in the personal relationships between individuals using and providing internet access) was a deep and near-permanent change in the lived experience and culture of the internet.\" Vinay then spends some time talking about identifying machines; MAC numbers; keypairs on your SIM card; and the DNS system, run by IANA. All of which work, to a large degree because they have to in order for the companies built on top of them to get paid, and because there is very little commercial competition for things like MAC numbers. So, we can identify machines fairly well (we'll return to DNS and HTTPS). Back to humans for now. Biometrics are appealing, in that they are not necessarily tightly associated with a State for issuance. However, \u201cyou only get one face\" or fingerprint and it is easy to exploit. People can make good-enough replicas of your features to break biometric authentication and then it is broken for good, unlike a password which can be changed. But what about DNA? While this is a perfect identifier - and offers a bunch of additional information about family, ancestry, health etc. - it is not private. Your DNA gets everywhere. And this points to a profound problem we will increasingly face with identifying technologies: \"Over and over, with biometric information, we are going to discover that the data itself is harmless, but the ability to compare the data with data from other sources is dangerous [...] being networked is a whole different story.\" There are many potential harms which arise from DNA, and Vinay claims that it will likely be \"a defining quandary of the 21 st century.\" This can be partially solved by hashing DNA sequences, though this is also not without its problems. All of which is to say that: \"We can be sure that handling personal DNA records is going to be at the core of the hardest problems in future privacy systems. It\u2019s also likely to be at the nexus of interests who want to be able to uniquely identify humans.\" Having covered the full landscape, Vinay turns to the intersection of biometrics and blockchains. The problem is that the model of identity encoded in Bitcoin revolves around cryptographic keypairs, which give us anonymity (or at least pseudonymity). You need never meet the other person to trust in the relevant properties of a transaction. This is great for many applications, but interfaces poorly with our current ID systems. Moreover, if we link your real name to a secret key, and then put all the actions taken with this secret key into a blockchain, you have zero privacy. \"When these two models collide, what\u2019s left is a kind of panopticon: a permanent record, tied to your real name, in a medium which cannot be erased. The 'web of trust' and 'the blockchain' are fundamentally different models of privacy [...] The 'public profile on a blockchain' model just does not seem to have the kinds of properties we want our societies to have.\" So, what are our options for future-proof identity which works for, rather than against, us? 1. Total transparency Which will lead us into Genetic Screening - think Tinder, but more scientific swiping/swabbing Identification - think global surveillance, but even more effective Research - think happier thoughts like open data Though this may seem strange now, we will likely get used to it, as we have grown used to each click being analyzed, or climate change, or any of a number of other crazy trends. In among all the potential negative side-effects, here is the most important point for you : \"This is the role of critical technologists \u2014 to understand that we have choices, that each technology comes with a set of decisions about how we will integrate it into our lives, societies, and culture [...] We must negotiate with each incoming possible future, and individually or collectively adopt or ignore the offers that these futures make us.\" 2. Blockchains, biometrics, encryption Apple Touch ID meets Bitcoin may seem convenient now, but when each technology independently matures, the intersection between them becomes huge and intrusive. We can potentially work with biometrics and lots of other personal information (like spending records) on a blockchain, but encrypt as much as possible as we go. However, it's likely that both our current cryptography - and understanding of computing power - will be obsolete sooner than we think. That is, if we put sensitive information on a blockchain and encrypt it, it is unlikely we can encrypt it well enough to keep it safe for even the next 30 to 50 years. 3. Wise as serpents We have arrived at the crux of the whole essay, which boils down to these three questions for future-proofing our systems: What does the world really need to know about us? What do specific agencies really need to know about us? Can we get through life revealing less about ourselves, using these technologies? If we consider these closely and agree that putting identifying information on chain - even if its encrypted - it's not such a hot idea, then we can get to what Vinay calls \"A transactional vision of the blockchain : something that\u2019s a little less about storing the entirety of our being on a permanent record, but more focused on disclosing the minimum required for people to be able to do business (or other critical functions) together [...] Every piece of personal information about you is stored with a different public key: you have a big keyring, and each key reveals only a single fact.\" If you think back to Understanding Ethereum and using a mnemonic to access not just monetary value, but an entire personal OS, then put this together with Vinay's essay and a service like ENS, you begin to see that your name is your mnemonic is your OS. Each sub-route under it controls different aspects of your identity, with different kinds of contractual requirements to access it. We can enforce highly secure, multi-party requirements for private information and what we now call wallets; and something more like SSO for social profiles, job hunting, contact details etc. Identity we can live with \"We have to be person-centered if we want to find a stable point which will survive the extremely rapid rates of change which are so much a part of our twenty first century. Put the person in the middle of the story, and work out from there, and generally speaking technological change will not break your model. \"I believe in a simple division of the identity space into two parts. Profiles Actions Profiles are a set of stories that somebody has about me. These might include things like medical records. I\u2019m describing these as stories because I, as an individual, have no idea what is in your profile of me. I cannot validate it. I might not even know it exists, and it might be filled with utter nonsense. Your profile is your business, even if its about me. Actions are a log of the places where I have made choices. These would typically be key life decisions, like signing an employment contract or mortgage, where the evidence that the signature was valid and accepted is a visible flow of money, ideally across the blockchain itself. In all cases actions ideally lead to a stream of payments into or (better still) out of an account, something which shows that the contract was actually performed.\" This is a simple, but profound way to consider a very complex problem. Currently, profiles and actions are inextricably mixed up, because someone else needs to verify your actions. \"On a blockchain, because my actions are self-certifying, like performative speech acts , I can present you with proof of what I have done without any third party having to vouch for me. This identity is all mine: self-sovereign.\" If you've made it this far and remember what Andreas and Nick have been saying about money as an ancient technology which birthed writing; money as a language which nobody owns or controls; money as a protocol anyone can engineer , you'll realise that one of the most interesting things that falls out of this unimaginable strangeness is the ability to speak clearly and in your own voice (i.e. with your own value) about who and what you are. We are only just beginning to scratch the surface of this unassailable fact. Of course, not everything fits neatly into profiles and actions. Vinay discusses \"privileged profiles\" made by those you trust more than me - i.e. Harvard University - and then goes into the intricacies of HTTPS, key management and Certificate Authorities as an anti-pattern. Bringing it home \"If we do not find a compelling alternative to profile-based identities, we are going to live in a world in which we exchange constant surveillance for services, from Facebook through to our own governments. The convergence of interests between national security and advertising is one of the most unholy pacts made in our time.\" To get out of this hole we have to find: New way of paying for services, and New ways of identifying ourselves \"I\u2019ve made the case that action-based rather than profile-based identities are possible for a large subset of adults [...] The result of this 'wise as a serpent' approach might be a mixed ecology of identity solutions, which serves us well enough to navigate around our world, without opening up some of the scary terrain which surrounds us [...] What is not disclosed can be disclosed in future, but what is published now is published forever, encrypted or not.\"","title":"Self Enquiry"},{"location":"module-4/self-enquiry/#who-are-you","text":"Almost everything we've discussed so far - trust , value , meaning , speech , freedom , intention , humility and art - depends in some way on the question of identity.

It's been hinted at in all the history we've looked through, and pointed to directly last week in both intention and the piece on Present Shock . It's time. Time and memory . We are time-binding animals , capable of temporal architecture. We create our experience of time with scripted behavior - everything from weekends to pension funds - based on linguistic assumptions about the past and future, just as we construct buildings out of steel and concrete. The internet has moved us into a new temporal landscape. We used to have a few ideologies which operated as social simulations, not just predicting possible futures, but actually creating our shared sense of historical time. Now, we have endlessly forking ideological narratives, increasingly built on a few shared networks of timestamp servers. Whatever will happen next? The Garden of Forking Memes Read It How does this fit into KERNEL? Aaron Lewis asks a most fascinating set of questions which will hopefully inform your own approach to thinking about the time we live in, and why an intentional approach to what we do and how we interact online really matters: How did the internet disrupt 20 th century timekeeping systems and spark an insurgence of alternative historical narratives? How do old media institutions try (and fail) to keep up with the narratives of online subcultures? How does the immediate accessibility of so many alt histories undermine our ability to create shared futures? And how might a more ecological awareness of the internet help us adapt to our disorienting digital time machines? Brief \"In my grandma\u2019s time, families could leave certain stories out and emphasize the good in the hope that doing so would create a better future. Today, digital media has taken that option off the table. The internet has flattened the vast archive of the past and made history unprecedentedly (and unrelentingly) immediate.\" The first few sections of this essay all point at the second and third order effects of digital tools, which takes us back to the humility we proposed in the play of pattern . The 'perfect memory' of databases has proven to be both a blessing and a curse, though it was not seen this way by the people who built them. We need to learn these lessons and realise that there is no up without down, no good without bad, no North without South, so that we can more consciously engineer the trade-offs made by our generation's tools and technology. Shared realities \"What Marshall McLuhan called the 'perfect memory' of computers has, in our time, spawned a garden of competing narratives and conceptions of the past/present/future [...] In today\u2019s chaotic media environment, not even a global pandemic can restore a shared sense of Reality.\" Was there ever a 'shared sense of Reality'? The real question is whether we need a shared sense of Reality to form valuable communities, or whether there is a different path which only shares non-contextual, transactional interactions? That is, at what level does one need to share reality to develop viable means of living together that are not totalitarian? \"The telegraph, time zones, radio, and television led to new patterns of mass connectivity and synchronization. Time was made visual and divided into smaller and smaller units that allowed us to achieve unprecedented levels of coordination [...] This trend has come to its logical conclusion because we all live inside a cage of time made up of 32 satellites orbiting Earth. [However, the psychological effects of the internet reveal how] twentieth century time was imposed on people from the top-down. Twenty-first century time is a bottom-up choose your own adventure story that allows people to make their own time machines and live any when .\" The internet has enabled ordinary people to once again create their own sense of time. This is the most powerful political tool there is. It's no mistake that Satoshi talks - at length - about \"timestamp servers\" in the Bitcoin whitepaper. This has always been what peer-to-peer technologies are about: freedom from authoritarian routines. \"The disruption of the old timekeeping regime created a void that\u2019s being filled by new online communities, cliques, and cults [...] People are seeking out groups and ideologies that put them 'back in time', and many internet subcultures do exactly that.\" Our sense of time defines how and what we value. It's critical to understand how a global web of light-speed communication and perfect memory has changed, and continues to change, how we perceive time. The alternative is to wander unconsciously what Aaron describes as the \"Web's surface\", always falling into the gravity wells which pull you into \"orbit around ideological sub-groups. Algorithms are the riverbed, and users are the water.\" No more guards This shifting time moves narrative power towards ideological subgroups who are already creating the next meme by the time Old Media reports on the previous iteration. \"The old guard is now left to study the activities and new realities of online tribes.

We can experience mythic consciousness, free from incorporated time. Of course, as Rushkoff said last week , this doesn't mean all our problems go away: \"Digital media has done away with the very thing that created our sense of history: imperfect memory [...] Forgetting is a feature, not a bug.

Designing algorithms is nothing new. So, before we get all New Age crypto-economic, let's turn to two of the most successful mechanisms designed in modern history: one business from just before the internet, and one which was birthed as a result of it. This week, we're traveling deep into the fractal forests , and there are miles to go before we sleep. Unbounded Search Read It How does the fit into KERNEL? This essay has been selected to show how critical incentives are, especially in the age of internet businesses and the unbounded search spaces over which they operate. Before writing effective economic code owned by no-one which benefits everyone, we have to understand the most successful mechanisms designed so far so that we can mimic their best parts and understand where they can actually be improved. Seeing how algorithms, platforms and incentives operate together will allow us to think more carefully about how to program our societies sustainably. Brief Zack Kanter explores what Amazon actually is by beginning with the business it first modeled itself on: Walmart. In order to understand the most successful commercial mechanism produced on and by the internet, we need to understand its retail analogue. Algorithms to sell by \"Few people outside of Walmart realize Walmart\u2019s historical scope of innovation. It built the largest private satellite communications network, enabling unprecedented coordination at enormous scale. Computerized point of sale systems, a massive trucking fleet to enable best-in-class logistics, innovations in EDI, the Sam\u2019s Club format.\" That is, Walmart can be thought of as a very simple formula which optimizes for the selection, pricing, and inventory of goods in a local store of some limited square footage. \"Sam Walton designed the Walmart algorithm: that is, a) \u201ca wide assortment of good quality merchandise\u201d, b) offered \u201cat the lowest possible prices,\u201d c) backed by \u201cguaranteed satisfaction\u201d and \u201cfriendly, knowledgeable service,\u201d d) available during \u201cconvenient hours\u201d with \u201cfree parking\u201d and \u201ca pleasant shopping experience,\u201d e) all within the largest, most convenient possible store size and location permitted by local economics.\" Walmart became the best in the world at using retail square footage as effectively as possible, stocking it with good quality merchandise at the lowest possible prices, and maintaining sufficient inventory to satisfy the resulting customer demand. \"Walmart can be thought of as a bounded search for the optimal selection , inventory, and pricing of SKUs that a local market could support. It was bound, or constrained, by the characteristics of the local economy, and so each Walmart location was a direct reflection of the local market dynamics [...] Higher-level managers were responsible for estimating the optimal size and location of the building itself, and for choosing the best associates to manage it. Each level of management had to manage their own level of the algorithm [...] This worked incredibly well until 1994 when \u2013 almost overnight \u2013 the algorithm that Walmart had methodically honed over the past three decades started to quietly work against it.\" Fractal forests \"Jeff Bezos had a big realization in 1994: the world of retail had, up until then, been a world where the most important thing was optimizing limited shelf space in service of satisfying the customer \u2013 but that world was about to change drastically. The advent of the internet \u2013 of online shopping \u2013 meant that an online retailer had infinite shelf space .\" This is the reason we go back and look at our roots - it leads to fascinating questions about what fundamental shifts in media environments are actually all about. It's often non-intuitive: who really cares about shelf space? Well, Bezos did and he's done fairly well as a result. Can we find the next ordinary parameter which has been blown away by flat protocols for value and write algorithms which not just enrich ourselves, but the entire community of people who use them? \ud83d\udca1 Bezos built an unbounded Walmart. What does an unbounded state look like? \"In this world of infinite shelf space, it wasn\u2019t the quality of the selection that mattered \u2013 it was pure quantity [...] Amazon's algorithm \u2013 borrowed and modified from Walmart \u2013 was simple: a) a vast selection, b) delivered fast, c) at the lowest possible prices, d) backed by guaranteed satisfaction [...] They correctly hypothesized that because vendor selection was not important in the world of infinite shelf space, Amazon itself \u2013 or, more accurately, its vendor onboarding process \u2013 would be the bottleneck to growth [...] In its effort to remove this bottleneck, Amazon opened its website to third party sellers.\" Open the gates! Amazon has never got as good as Walmart at negotiating prices, but they don't need to , because even if they 'lose' the price negotiation to a third party, they still gain a data point; the customer stays on their site; and they charge a 12-15% commission. All they did at first was systematically remove friction for sellers, doing small things like eliminating the UPC code requirement that would serve as a barrier for newer, less established sellers. \"To make sense of what started to happen after Amazon rolled out Marketplace, you have to understand that things get really weird when you run an unbounded search at internet-scale. When you remove \u201cnormal\u201d constraints imposed by the physical world, the scale can get so massive that all of the normal approaches start to break down.\" Walmart had solved these almost-impossible problems for a business of its scale, and engineered a genuine marvel of the modern world focused on thinking small to stamp out any possible ineficiency and optimize its shelf space. Amazon had to find a way of abdicating responsibility for solving these problems altogether . After solving the vendor bottleneck problem, the next issue raised by unbounded search and infinite shelf space was computing power and data storage. Engineers had to wait weeks to get servers provisioned etc. So, Amazon began to build a platform that would allow its software engineers to provision on-demand resources immediately. Moreover, they couldn't develop features on the website fast enough to take advantage of all the merchandising opportunities. In a radical move, the platform \u2013 Amazon\u2019s own technological infrastructure \u2013 would be made available to external developers, too. It would be called Amazon Web Services [...] In a similarly radical move, Bezos decided to expose Amazon\u2019s entire product catalog via an API so that any software developer, internal or external, could access Amazon\u2019s catalog and use the SKU data, within reason, in any way they saw fit. This should remind you of Andreas Antonopoulos' point about how we're in the midst of a move from closed organizations, to platforms accessible through APIs, to open protocols . Platforms spring up as a necessity borne from unbound searches running at internet scale. \"Circa 2002, we start to see the emergence of a pattern: 1) Amazon had encountered a bottleneck to growth, 2) it had determined that some internal process or resource was the bottleneck, 3) it had realized that it could not possibly develop and deploy enough resources internally to remove that bottleneck, so 4) it instead removed the bottleneck by building an interface to allow the broader market to solve it en masse. This exact pattern was repeated with vendor selection (Amazon Marketplace), technology infrastructure (Amazon Web Services, or AWS), and merchandising (Amazon\u2019s Catalog API). Platforms are the algorithm Walmart built Retail Link to share its inventory levels and internal projections with vendors. However, there is a crucial difference: lock-in. Because the suppliers who want to sell through Walmart must use Retail Link, there's no external pressure to keep improving the service. \"When a service has captive customers, it will degrade compared to market alternatives.\" Amazon faced this problem with AWS, but solved it by opening up the platform to all customers and itself becoming a customer of AWS . It thus solved its own technological bottleneck without falling into the trap of vertical integration. \"In 2002, Jeff Bezos had the most important insight he would ever have: in the world of infinite shelf space \u2013 and platforms to fill them \u2013 the limiting reagent for Amazon\u2019s growth would not be its website traffic, or its ability to fulfill orders, or the number of SKUs available to sell; it would be its own bureaucracy. \"Bezos issued an edict: 1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through interfaces, 2) teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces, 3) all interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be exposed to developers in the outside world, and 4) anyone who doesn\u2019t do this will be fired. \" \ud83d\udca1 Platforms became Amazon\u2019s answer to every growth obstacle it encountered. Platforms became part of the algorithm. \"Bezos designed Amazon\u2019s algorithm. His first stroke of genius was in making it unbounded; his second \u2013 the masterstroke \u2013 was devising a solution to the bureaucratic complexity that would have otherwise caused it to implode. Instead of being a bureaucratic liability, Amazon\u2019s sprawl would become a massive surface area of customer contact from which Amazon could spawn dozens of revenue streams.\" Unsolved: advertising With infinite shelf space, the next big problem is discoverability . Typically, this was answered with a platform: Amazon Advertising. \"Sponsored Products\" go at the top of search, help sellers get in front of customers, help customers find the latest and greatest goods, and generate pure revenue for Amazon - $8bn of it. However, this is not actually good for customers - it's only good for sellers who are good at advertising, favoring products with the highest gross margin, not those which are necessarily best for the customer. People can't readily distinguish between organic search and sponsored products and so are unlikely to be buying the optimal product. Large, sponsored listings drag the average quality of products sold closer to mediocrity, and further from greatness. Zack suggests a lifespan on product reviews as a possible solution, though this seems like a temporary patch on a systemic issue. Moreover, he highlights how Amazon is likely addicted to that $8bn in revenue, which sponsors over of its R D budget. \"This is an absolutely devastating misstep for Amazon\u2019s retail business. This isn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d search results; search results are the entire driver of Amazon\u2019s retail engine. Remember that in the world of infinite shelf space, the ranking algorithm is practically the entire merchandising strategy.

It was bound, or constrained, by the characteristics of the local economy, and so each Walmart location was a direct reflection of the local market dynamics [...] Higher-level managers were responsible for estimating the optimal size and location of the building itself, and for choosing the best associates to manage it. Each level of management had to manage their own level of the algorithm [...] This worked incredibly well until 1994 when \u2013 almost overnight \u2013 the algorithm that Walmart had methodically honed over the past three decades started to quietly work against it.\"","title":"Algorithms to sell by"},{"location":"module-5/amazon-unbounded-search/#fractal-forests","text":"\"Jeff Bezos had a big realization in 1994: the world of retail had, up until then, been a world where the most important thing was optimizing limited shelf space in service of satisfying the customer \u2013 but that world was about to change drastically. The advent of the internet \u2013 of online shopping \u2013 meant that an online retailer had infinite shelf space .\" This is the reason we go back and look at our roots - it leads to fascinating questions about what fundamental shifts in media environments are actually all about. It's often non-intuitive: who really cares about shelf space? Well, Bezos did and he's done fairly well as a result. Can we find the next ordinary parameter which has been blown away by flat protocols for value and write algorithms which not just enrich ourselves, but the entire community of people who use them? \ud83d\udca1 Bezos built an unbounded Walmart. What does an unbounded state look like? \"In this world of infinite shelf space, it wasn\u2019t the quality of the selection that mattered \u2013 it was pure quantity [...] Amazon's algorithm \u2013 borrowed and modified from Walmart \u2013 was simple: a) a vast selection, b) delivered fast, c) at the lowest possible prices, d) backed by guaranteed satisfaction [...] They correctly hypothesized that because vendor selection was not important in the world of infinite shelf space, Amazon itself \u2013 or, more accurately, its vendor onboarding process \u2013 would be the bottleneck to growth [...] In its effort to remove this bottleneck, Amazon opened its website to third party sellers.\"","title":"Fractal forests"},{"location":"module-5/amazon-unbounded-search/#open-the-gates","text":"Amazon has never got as good as Walmart at negotiating prices, but they don't need to , because even if they 'lose' the price negotiation to a third party, they still gain a data point; the customer stays on their site; and they charge a 12-15% commission. All they did at first was systematically remove friction for sellers, doing small things like eliminating the UPC code requirement that would serve as a barrier for newer, less established sellers. \"To make sense of what started to happen after Amazon rolled out Marketplace, you have to understand that things get really weird when you run an unbounded search at internet-scale. When you remove \u201cnormal\u201d constraints imposed by the physical world, the scale can get so massive that all of the normal approaches start to break down.\" Walmart had solved these almost-impossible problems for a business of its scale, and engineered a genuine marvel of the modern world focused on thinking small to stamp out any possible ineficiency and optimize its shelf space. Amazon had to find a way of abdicating responsibility for solving these problems altogether . After solving the vendor bottleneck problem, the next issue raised by unbounded search and infinite shelf space was computing power and data storage. Engineers had to wait weeks to get servers provisioned etc. So, Amazon began to build a platform that would allow its software engineers to provision on-demand resources immediately. Moreover, they couldn't develop features on the website fast enough to take advantage of all the merchandising opportunities. In a radical move, the platform \u2013 Amazon\u2019s own technological infrastructure \u2013 would be made available to external developers, too. It would be called Amazon Web Services [...] In a similarly radical move, Bezos decided to expose Amazon\u2019s entire product catalog via an API so that any software developer, internal or external, could access Amazon\u2019s catalog and use the SKU data, within reason, in any way they saw fit. This should remind you of Andreas Antonopoulos' point about how we're in the midst of a move from closed organizations, to platforms accessible through APIs, to open protocols . Platforms spring up as a necessity borne from unbound searches running at internet scale. \"Circa 2002, we start to see the emergence of a pattern: 1) Amazon had encountered a bottleneck to growth, 2) it had determined that some internal process or resource was the bottleneck, 3) it had realized that it could not possibly develop and deploy enough resources internally to remove that bottleneck, so 4) it instead removed the bottleneck by building an interface to allow the broader market to solve it en masse. This exact pattern was repeated with vendor selection (Amazon Marketplace), technology infrastructure (Amazon Web Services, or AWS), and merchandising (Amazon\u2019s Catalog API).","title":"Open the gates!"},{"location":"module-5/amazon-unbounded-search/#platforms-are-the-algorithm","text":"Walmart built Retail Link to share its inventory levels and internal projections with vendors. However, there is a crucial difference: lock-in. Because the suppliers who want to sell through Walmart must use Retail Link, there's no external pressure to keep improving the service. \"When a service has captive customers, it will degrade compared to market alternatives.\" Amazon faced this problem with AWS, but solved it by opening up the platform to all customers and itself becoming a customer of AWS . It thus solved its own technological bottleneck without falling into the trap of vertical integration. \"In 2002, Jeff Bezos had the most important insight he would ever have: in the world of infinite shelf space \u2013 and platforms to fill them \u2013 the limiting reagent for Amazon\u2019s growth would not be its website traffic, or its ability to fulfill orders, or the number of SKUs available to sell; it would be its own bureaucracy. \"Bezos issued an edict: 1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through interfaces, 2) teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces, 3) all interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be exposed to developers in the outside world, and 4) anyone who doesn\u2019t do this will be fired. \" \ud83d\udca1 Platforms became Amazon\u2019s answer to every growth obstacle it encountered.

Typically, this was answered with a platform: Amazon Advertising. \"Sponsored Products\" go at the top of search, help sellers get in front of customers, help customers find the latest and greatest goods, and generate pure revenue for Amazon - $8bn of it. However, this is not actually good for customers - it's only good for sellers who are good at advertising, favoring products with the highest gross margin, not those which are necessarily best for the customer. People can't readily distinguish between organic search and sponsored products and so are unlikely to be buying the optimal product. Large, sponsored listings drag the average quality of products sold closer to mediocrity, and further from greatness.

Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.\u201d \u2014 Kurt Vonnegut , 1974 Read it How does this fit into KERNEL? The incentives which support power are primarily based on narratives and we can influence these structures by establishing common knowledge and playing the players. We know we can program incentive structures at the kinds of scale required to influence the behaviour of large groups of humans; we know how to design these such that they reveal valuable truths with very little contrivance. Now the question is: how can we best research, understand and model the kinds of behaviour which will lead to sustainable societies? What happens when the common knowledge we establish is fundamentally prosocial? \"What would game design look like if our goals included reducing loneliness , decreasing toxicity and boosting a player\u2019s positive connections with others?\" Brief Loneliness causes stress, depression, reduced lifespan and can lead to short-term thinking associated with long-term net negative outcomes. Too often, our technologies and the games we design with them exacerbate, rather than solve this problem. This is not just applicable to children, but to our whole society. However, problems are always also opportunities: \"Combining the known severity of the consequences of loneliness with the connections shown between games, technology, and loneliness, it becomes clear that this is a pressing issue [...] As the median age of the world population rises, there\u2019s an opportunity as increasing numbers of older people play games.\" There\u2019s a growing recognition that toxicity in online communities results from weak social design combined with weak enforcement of positive social norms. When we're lonely and stressed, our desire to belong gets expressed in negative ways like trolling for attention or destroying the connections between others we are failing to make or enjoy ourselves. Critically, toxic behaviour isn't necessarily adversarial: badly designed systems actually generate toxicity. The broad solution to both these problems is to design systems that build relationships between players . The Grand Project Designing to increase social capital requires expertise in at least three distinct domains. Project Horseshoe wrote about psychology in 2016, logistics and scale in 2018, and this paper focuses on economics. It is by understanding these three fields together that we can begin to design truly interesting, prosocial mechanisms to help us map and navigate the intersubjective space Dandelion talked about last week . Many of the key elements required by the psychological and logistical aspects of friendship formation are systematically undervalued within common economic practices. Game designers, however, are concerned with the flow and transformation of resources, value, and incentives for player behavior - that is, the internal economy , rather than strict \"micro\" or \"macro\" formalisms. Though these are toy economies, and have well-defined boundaries with the real world, we can still build meaningful relationships between virtual objects. These elements originate mostly in systems theory and include: tokens, sources, pools, sinks and transforms, agents like the player, and \"black boxes\". Together, these elements and agents can be used to model the entire internal economy, and balance our games with the correct incentive structures. Mapping game economies to the real world is challenging: the latter has limited resources and unlimited needs; whereas games are abundant digital universes in which consumption and ownership can mean different things. Moreover, economics does not account well for computation and psychology: the common behavioral models of rational, atomic individuals who are the best judges of their needs and who exist within weak social networks seem deeply flawed. Economists must rely on measurement via proxy and weak sampling, whereas game developers have a panopticon that records every possible player interaction. Moreover, most economists assume a price for everything, but this basic assumption distorts greatly our transactional relationships, it undervalues our long term relationships, and it over-emphasizes short term measurable improvements. Human groups create public goods in the form of unmeasured relationships, social norms and cultural practices. These public goods are incredibly valuable in terms of individual health and happiness. Yet they are not readily measured by economic transactions. Economics in general struggles with public goods, and social public goods are even more invisible. \ud83d\udca1 \"The practice of economics erases many of the social phenomena we are interested in examining.\" Economics, as a discipline, suffers from a \"replication crisis\" - many large scale theories are only testable in the world and the experiments meant to measure them inevitably lack power and scope. In this sense, it is less of a science and more a historical kind of map-making that has increasingly been pulled into politics, rhetoric and ideology. Here's the conundrum: we need to design and build balanced economic systems, but our tools suck. Prosocial value patterns We can begin by being intentional about both our explicit and implicit values, and developing an aesthetic which creates a player experience that best supports our values. Critically, this needs to be measurable - game design is an engineering craft. To achieve this, we'll use economics as a design practice rather than a science. There are truths in economic systems: trade creates value (or destroys it if we miss a key externality); supply and demand generally work, etc. We can use these to adopt an explicitly prosocial set of values in our games and economies: Friendship : The formation and maintenance of healthy, meaningful friendship networks. Thriving individuals : The facilitation of eudaimonic happiness. Players feel competence, volition, and relatedness, both for themselves and for their friends. Altruism : The promotion of activities that involve intrinsically motivated cooperation. Positive group norms : The spread and enforcement of shared altruistic social norms within and across groups. Shared goals : Players work towards those goals via mutual interdependence, and achieve feelings of purpose and meaningfulness. By being explicit about these values, we can engineer our games and economies away from individual and group toxicity, and the resulting loneliness they engender. Responsible social systems design requires an ethical core. Much like medical doctors, we are operating on human beings. Huge populations of humans, in fact. As ethical practitioners, we need our own equivalent of the Hippocratic oath. We should do no harm and, if possible, improve the social health of our players. Friendship Instead of the rational optimizer model, we can use contextual reciprocity to map friendship as a key value for prosocial game design. All friendships, though different, have common factors : proximity , repeat encounters , reciprocity , disclosure . Successful reciprocity loops increase value and effort over time and, as this process goes on, the more players trust each other. Highly trusted friends form key long-term support networks in times of need. We can accelerate friendship formation with three keys: similarity , intensity , and autonomy support . That is, the more similar people feel, the more intense the emotional situations in which they interact, and the more they encourage each other's choices; the more likely they are to become lasting friends. Trust As trust in a community increases, support networks flourish. However, it's really difficult to measure trust, so we need to rely on some proxies: player's pairwise bonds , active time spent together , success together in high trust situations , and time spent talking positively . These can then be tuned by the observant developer team to increase total trust over time for each pair, the rate of trust accumulation, and to create trust metrics for higher order groups. The paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of Steambirds data collection methods: A mistake we made early on was looking primarily at metrics like retention and monetization. These don\u2019t tell us much about what motivates players to play. If I were to build the game again, I would have implemented the togetherness metric for the very first private alpha. Player relationships are top-level intrinsic motivators and by only measuring them late in the process, we completely misunderstood the state of the game we were building. Of course, the challenge here is that you can't share your trust metrics in the game because if you show people what you're observing about them, it irrevocably changes their behavior. Sharing group health though - if vague, delayed and multi-dimensional so that it can't be gamed - can encourage prosocial behaviour. Trust also differs across contexts, which makes it even more difficult to measure: at best we need to track multiple trust metrics in multiple contexts. Positive sum resources There are only a few examples of these in the world: time and information being the two most obvious ones. However, these are a key economic tool for cooperative game play. This area of exploration is connected to the software theory of agalmics : non-scarce resources. Whether or not players compete over a resources becomes a design choice, not a fundamental constraint. We need to look for competition or toxicity and design away any non-zero resources at the heart of such interactions. You may ask whether this will destroy our incentives to compete, but cumulative scores are an inherent positive sum resource (everyone gets some independent of other players), and coordination games are every bit as popular as other kinds. If there are infinite resources, won't we just have imbalanced economies? It is important to internalize that as a game economy designer, you control the sources, the sinks and the narrative justification for why the world works as it does. Scarcity as well as abundance are aesthetic choices. There are arbitrary per player caps, or per group caps, or transaction costs, or sinks that can achieve balanced incentive structures. Again, the mapping from games to real world is not exact: our total relationship budget is itself zero sum. We are limited by Dunbar's number, but this is perhaps where we can consider those higher level trust metrics like inter-group cooperation. Knowledge resources Paul Romer has argued that learned transformations on scarce zero-sum resources result in more efficient use: wood burning in a stove vs in an open pit can generate and store far more heat. A prosocial attribute of knowledge is that supply is determined by the number of clever people you have creating it. Since knowledge is research by clever people, the more clever people we have playing, the more knowledge we\u2019ll likely gain [...] Appropriately designed knowledge good econonies mean more smart players are an advantage, not a threat. Some examples of knowledge in game worlds include technological process , explorable spaces , and player skills . Like most knowledge goods, these skills are teachable and create an economy of attention and narrative based on passing skills efficiently onto other learners. Streamers showcase their knowledge goods - one of the reasons for their popularity. Of course, virtual skills and knowledge can be passed on in all sorts of ways - as tokens, \"unlocks\" etc. - and so the critical part becomes the transfer mechanism you design. The paper mentions fun variations where an advanced player can only advance further if they manage to teach a newer player one of these virtual skills. These creates a tit-for-tat reciprocation loop where both players are getting something they need. In general, when setting up transfer mechanisms, try to create a natural interdependency between players. Economic mechanisms that encourage players to seek out and interact with other players helps facilitate the friendship equation. Voting Resources Votes are positive sum economic resources! If we reframe them in economic terms, we gain a large number of tools for manipulating and building novel prosocial voting economies. The paper cites Beartopia, where \"crafting ingredients\" take the form of berries which can be gathered once a minimum of work had been done. For large projects that consume public space, it requires lots of crafting ingredients - i.e. high levels of coordination - to execute. This is directly equivalent to storage on Ethereum . Smaller scale, more ephemeral projects require less participation. We wanted to empower individuals to make local changes, but ensure the system needed the political power of increasingly larger groups to make more permanent communal changes. This is crucial: in a virtual universe, you need not use the same language of voting and politics to achieve the same end results! We get so caught up in the inertia of our current linguistic paradigms that we can't think creatively about how to achieve the desired results without recourse to the same old formalisms. Use games to free yourself. Interdependent roles Division of labor increases efficiency and so is pervasive through social systems design. It incentivizes both specialization and coordination and is fueled by trust. However, such high trust requirements - and the reputational and actual costs of failing in high coordination tasks - tend to intimidate people. Successful games have a ladder of activities , starting with low trust activities between generalists, before moving into higher trust coordination games between specialists. Shared Vulnerability Shared struggle acts as social glue and facilitates tight bonds of trust and higher social cohesion. The paper cites Eve Online and the guild rituals people created for recruiting new members. One high functioning guild would recruit players by giving them understandable tasks and then leading them into a battle where they would all die, together. It was intended as a bonding exercise, after which all materials were replaced. This creates high retention in groups through shared memory and an establishment of interdependence , loyalty , and generosity . The challenge is to calibrate the kind of shared vulnerability and manage a thoughtful transition to more peaceful forms of gameplay that amount to recovery therapy. Moreover, this example is about tribes with in-group/out-group dynamics, and it isn\u2019t clear how it would translate to a non-zero-sum shared massive environment. Player to player trade Trade allows both parties to benefit and increases the overall value in the game. Trade can improve human relationships through creating more overall abundance, and by getting individual people to engage in reciprocal negotiation and relationship-building. However, boiling everything down to one, auctionable price is not necessarily prosocial. Given that scarcity in digital environments is a design choice, there are numerous options available to solving this which the paper discusses, that are cut here for the sake of at least some brevity. Tying social metrics to business success This is the hardest pattern to implement, because it takes us back to the problem that \"the practice of economics erases many of the social phenomena we are interested in examining\". Nevertheless, the paper suggests some ways to do this and then warns that implementing them will very likely lead into the next section. Dark patterns \"Ignorance does not create ideologically neutral games.\" Prosocial economics explicitly brings the tools of economics into social system design. And it promises to be an effective and scalable means of promoting societal values. This combination is a honeypot for bad actors . There is a future where the basic social technologies we\u2019ve described in this paper will be used to create systems of immense evil, debasing the very aspects of friendship that we seek to elevate. The paper cites as examples of dark patterns both Facebook's advertising model and China's social credit system. Ideologically motivated groups can easily adopt these practices to inject toxic behaviour into social systems, but the antidote to this is not locking the knowledge up: it's spreading it as far as possible so more of us can more readily identify such dark patterns. Optimizing for proxies, rather than the actual social phenomena : this can take the form of viral installs, GDP, or even the \"togetherness\" metric in Steambirds cited above. It is potentially mitigated by more holistic metrics, cross-functional teams and player interviews. Over reliance on extrinsic motivators : we can \"crowd out\" complicated, intrinsic motivators with extrinsic motivators that are much easier to standardize, code and implement. We can mitigate this by explicitly designing for individual players and their personal journeys, rather than for aggregates of average players. Importantly, we must also scope metrics correctly: internal, private, group and public and think carefully about what we share with whom and the effect it will have on various behavioral incentive loops. Replacing prosocial with selfish values : economists tend towards evil for a variety of reasons. Tracking and focusing on currency seems to lead to rationalizations that justify selfish behavior. When we embed extrinsic, currency-based values in our identity as individuals and tribes, these just get amplified at larger social layers and more deeply entrenched, which results in clashes of dogma and doctrine which are no-win. As alternatives, we can re-emphasize the patterns described above: Be explicit about key prosocial values Tie economic value to the maintenance of prosocial value Don\u2019t put business in control of prosocial systems Hire prosocial executives that know the value of these systems Establish ethics standards for social systems designers Weaving the threads together We can summarize this into three key prosocial mechanics and economic patterns to promote: Measuring the unmeasured : trust and positive sum resources, knowledge in particular. Facilitating connection : building for friendship formation, encouraging trade and fostering shared vulnerability. Facilitating expression : through voting resources as economic tools and integrating social metrics with business success. There are so many areas which you can use this initial exploration to dive into: group leveling; friendship resources; incentivizing generosity; nurture play; and expressive orthogonality through fashion. Ideally, we should aim to use the above prosocial design patterns to explore the space of positive sum resource design and public good design (see Liberal Radicalism as one example of such an exploration); to build better cognitive behaviour therapy systems and help manage social skill development across societies. Of course, a core area of concern is transferring these insights from the game world to the real one, and this is where cryptocurrencies seem uniquely valuable. Cryptoeconomic mechanism design is all about the interface between value in a digital and \"actual\" sense - it's about how we can use programmable money to influence the way societies organize and function.

However, problems are always also opportunities: \"Combining the known severity of the consequences of loneliness with the connections shown between games, technology, and loneliness, it becomes clear that this is a pressing issue [...] As the median age of the world population rises, there\u2019s an opportunity as increasing numbers of older people play games.\" There\u2019s a growing recognition that toxicity in online communities results from weak social design combined with weak enforcement of positive social norms.

Project Horseshoe wrote about psychology in 2016, logistics and scale in 2018, and this paper focuses on economics. It is by understanding these three fields together that we can begin to design truly interesting, prosocial mechanisms to help us map and navigate the intersubjective space Dandelion talked about last week . Many of the key elements required by the psychological and logistical aspects of friendship formation are systematically undervalued within common economic practices. Game designers, however, are concerned with the flow and transformation of resources, value, and incentives for player behavior - that is, the internal economy , rather than strict \"micro\" or \"macro\" formalisms. Though these are toy economies, and have well-defined boundaries with the real world, we can still build meaningful relationships between virtual objects. These elements originate mostly in systems theory and include: tokens, sources, pools, sinks and transforms, agents like the player, and \"black boxes\". Together, these elements and agents can be used to model the entire internal economy, and balance our games with the correct incentive structures. Mapping game economies to the real world is challenging: the latter has limited resources and unlimited needs; whereas games are abundant digital universes in which consumption and ownership can mean different things. Moreover, economics does not account well for computation and psychology: the common behavioral models of rational, atomic individuals who are the best judges of their needs and who exist within weak social networks seem deeply flawed. Economists must rely on measurement via proxy and weak sampling, whereas game developers have a panopticon that records every possible player interaction. Moreover, most economists assume a price for everything, but this basic assumption distorts greatly our transactional relationships, it undervalues our long term relationships, and it over-emphasizes short term measurable improvements. Human groups create public goods in the form of unmeasured relationships, social norms and cultural practices. These public goods are incredibly valuable in terms of individual health and happiness. Yet they are not readily measured by economic transactions. Economics in general struggles with public goods, and social public goods are even more invisible. \ud83d\udca1 \"The practice of economics erases many of the social phenomena we are interested in examining.\" Economics, as a discipline, suffers from a \"replication crisis\" - many large scale theories are only testable in the world and the experiments meant to measure them inevitably lack power and scope.

Critically, this needs to be measurable - game design is an engineering craft. To achieve this, we'll use economics as a design practice rather than a science. There are truths in economic systems: trade creates value (or destroys it if we miss a key externality); supply and demand generally work, etc. We can use these to adopt an explicitly prosocial set of values in our games and economies: Friendship : The formation and maintenance of healthy, meaningful friendship networks. Thriving individuals : The facilitation of eudaimonic happiness. Players feel competence, volition, and relatedness, both for themselves and for their friends. Altruism : The promotion of activities that involve intrinsically motivated cooperation. Positive group norms : The spread and enforcement of shared altruistic social norms within and across groups. Shared goals : Players work towards those goals via mutual interdependence, and achieve feelings of purpose and meaningfulness.

So, let's take them at their word and see what the best indie developers in the world have to say about designing valuable games. How does the fit into KERNEL? You may be asking what computer games have to do with token design. Though the universe of games is fictional, the whole point of this talk is to demonstrate how the truths you will learn in a valuable game apply in general. So the real question is: what universe do blockchains instantiate? We've already suggested the answer: a universe of distributed trust . Now, like any good game designer, we have to find the \"nuggets of truth\" in this world, and present them to everyone with the lightest possible contrivance. We could teach you about the different kinds of constant function market makers , but these are just one particular flavour of one kind of nugget within the entire universe of applications made possible by distributed trust. We want to demonstrate the principle here: virtuous games lead to valuable truth. The better we design our games, the more clearly we can share our truths. Brief Jonathan begins with a description of Portal 2, and demonstrates discovering a game mechanic to do with using light bridges in such a way that you explore otherwise impossible-to-reach places. He also shows a classic game - vvvvvv - which allows you to change the direction of gravity for your character. Out of this single, incredibly simple rule, you can build mechanics that allow the character to traverse 180 degree bends and full circles, opening the game up into all sorts of fun and revealing mazes with just one rule. Such mechanics are: little nuggets of truth the designer has found and packaged for the player. Now, I am calling them 'truth' even though you, as a player, encounter them as pieces of a fictional game-world that doesn't exist. But, if you think carefully about these things: they are about subjects which pertain to the real world. These often reveal sophisticated understandings of the universe - likes lines intersecting in 2-D space, but being one below the other in 3 dimensions (as in Portal 2), yet in game play, it happens very naturally. This is a lot like what mathematicians do: they build higher-order constructs out of primitive \"what if?\" questions and then explore the consequences . If you learn only one thing this week, let it be this: mechanism design is about asking the most simple \"what if?\" question you can and then exploring the possibility space it implies fully. This is the aesthetic of game design: Mine nuggets of truth. Package that truth for the player. Games are both toy universes and complex mathematical systems, and mathematics is an \"unreasonably effective\" tool for understanding the universe. In particular, mathematicians seem to agree that the shortest theorems which carry the deepest consequences are the \"most beautiful.\" These are the nuggets we're looking for in the design of any mechanism. Exploring well Start with a mechanic; like a grappling hook that you can shoot and pull yourself with. Or be more vague, beginning with a detail or consequence without being sure of the framework around it. For instance: a puzzle game where you know that you want players to remember a melody and recite it back at some stage, but don't know exactly how. Aim towards the richest space , explore it completely , and trace a strong boundary around it. Present the results cleanly and with the least contrivance to get closer to the truth. Marc talks about a 4-dimensional game he designed, where the mechanic is a button you can press to switch one of the dimensions. This dimensionality results in strange and wonderful connections between universes, such that you can pass through walls, or \"climb\" to rewards on them you wouldn't otherwise be able to reach. It's worth remembering May Li Khoe and Khan Academy . Great mechanism design revolves around small nuggets of truth, packaged with the least contrivance for people to find and experience themselves: much like negative numbers granting kids super powers when they adventure to the left of the number line, or the visual properties of prime numbers falling out their work on simple addition and subtraction. Mechanism design is not about making complex systems! It is about simplifying complex insights so that people can learn them intuitively through use (which is joyful), not explicitly through study (which is boring and contrived). Jonathan discusses a puzzle pattern game he made - The Witness - and the \"game-feel\" reasons which led him to certain constraints for drawing the solutions to puzzles. These range from ease of use across platforms to the aesthetic feel different rules - or the lack of them - induce. Before he even knew what the puzzles were, he had set up a system which could combine well with other mechanics . This is critical: exploration of low-level primitives yields possibility . Virtuous design We can define 8 criteria by which we can evaluate the \"virtue\" of different possibilities we stumble upon in our design process: Richness - adjust the mechanic(s) to get the most interesting consequences. Once you know you want to switch between 4 dimensions, or solve puzzles on a constrained grid; iterate over the sub-mechanics. Add terrain to explore in those dimensions, or think about the puzzle as drawing a partition between different spaces on the constrained grid. Completeness - are there consequences we haven't found? Jonathan discusses Braid, where the main mechanic is that you can rewind time, with a sub-mechanic that some objects are immune to this ability. This sub-mechanic is an exploratory question and, in order to satisfy the completeness criterion, it must be applied to every object in the game. That said, there is a deep balance between \"throwing something crazy\" at players as they first arrive in the game world, which impedes their ability to learn; and holding it back entirely, which makes the game feel incomplete. Surprise - maximize the amount of information contained within a limited and constrained package. It is the counterbalancing force to completeness and is created with high level expressions built from low-level concepts; or by combining game mechanics. Lightest Contrivance - \u201cthe less contrivance you have, the closer to the truth you\u2019ll get\u201d. This applies to both mechanics and level design. There is an elegance to simple rules and an ugliness to complex ones. There's also a proportionality here: if you have 2 mechanics, one of which leads to a good deal of surprising and sublime results, and another which is twice as complicated and yields the same amount of results, then relative to each other, the second will feel ugly. Strength of Boundary - having done the above, we must now focus in on our surprisingly elegant consequences and remove mechanics which do not provide enough surprise; are not relatively as rich as others; do not fit our refined definition of the game we're designing; create an unfocused space of consequences; or overlap too much. Compatibility - mechanics need to complement each other, and this idea is confined by both richness and completeness. Only add mechanics that interact with all aspects of your game. Orthogonality - basically: your mechanics shouldn't overlap or have similar results. The example Marc gives is Ikaruga: a shoot-them-up where you can shoot or switch colors, which are great examples of totally orthogonal principles. Generosity - this is the consequence of orthogonality and completeness and is about having mechanics that are not limited to the player . That is, you can always go into the fourth dimension, or you can always rewind time: there is nothing that limits you as these are precisely the mechanics we wish to explore. Though this is specifically about computer game design, we can apply exactly the same kind of thinking to open networks of distributed trust. As Juan Benet noted, verifiability is the key mechanic in Web 3 , and instant settlement and transfer of ownership are examples of interesting sub-mechanics which have not yet been completely explored. The value of truth Jonathan asks: \"How do you make a good puzzle?\" It's not by making it hard. It's not even by trying to make it good. It's by looking for truth and illustrating it with the puzzle. The point of the puzzle is to show some truth. Know what that truth is. Eliminate anything which is not about that truth. The question then becomes, \"how do we ensure the player can grasp this truth?\" It's not about brute-force attempts: information needs to build up over each attempt, as it reveals more about the game mechanics at work. The space around the truth is often more valuable than the truth itself. Importantly, we're not talking about arbitrary things here: we are talking about principles which are valuable in and of themselves, outside the game. Great games and great mechanics have the same quality of unreasonable effectiveness as math does: they are particular illustrations of general truths. Another way to achieve this is with a hierarchy of ideas : When you can have a sequence and there is a pattern along the sequence, a player can have a gradually-dawning surprise, or a sublime growth in understanding, about what the sequence points to. This happens regularly and naturally in all games as increasingly complicated mechanics or combinations are introduced, but it can also \"take the form of a conversation about things which are not quite parallel to the mechanics themselves\". Jonathan illustrates this by returning to the constrained grids of The Witness. Importantly, these non-verbal communications through game mechanics have to do with teaching players a certain pattern , and then getting them to break their perception of that pattern to see higher-order concepts . By removing anything arbitrary, the designer is abdicating authorship over the puzzle. \"The Universe\" is the real designer of the puzzle. So the puzzle feels more fair, because it's not about reading the mind of the designer, it's about reading the mind of \"mother nature\". If you make a game that encapsulates the truth in some way, then - even if your other design skills are poor - you will have captured something valuable. So, what is the truth you want to encapsulate with your mechanism, and what is the smallest possible set of rich low-level questions you can ask which will allow you to explore it completely and come up with something which is ultimately about generosity? When we build games in this way, we're pointing many lenses at the universe to see what's out there. This is really valuable, because games in this sense are another tool - like mathematics - in the toolbox that humanity can use to understand the world.","title":"Reveals Universes"},{"location":"module-5/reveal-the-universe/#revealing-the-universe","text":"\" The overall goal is: show a lot of truth, with minimum contrivance\" - Jonathan Blow Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen suggested that transformative tools - especially public goods - stood to learn a lot from game designers, who have far more complete emotional and psychological models of human behaviour than anyone else in the digital world. So, let's take them at their word and see what the best indie developers in the world have to say about designing valuable games.","title":"\ud83e\udde9 Revealing the universe"},{"location":"module-5/reveal-the-universe/#how-does-the-fit-into-kernel","text":"You may be asking what computer games have to do with token design. Though the universe of games is fictional, the whole point of this talk is to demonstrate how the truths you will learn in a valuable game apply in general. So the real question is: what universe do blockchains instantiate? We've already suggested the answer: a universe of distributed trust . Now, like any good game designer, we have to find the \"nuggets of truth\" in this world, and present them to everyone with the lightest possible contrivance. We could teach you about the different kinds of constant function market makers , but these are just one particular flavour of one kind of nugget within the entire universe of applications made possible by distributed trust. We want to demonstrate the principle here: virtuous games lead to valuable truth. The better we design our games, the more clearly we can share our truths.","title":"How does the fit into KERNEL?"},{"location":"module-5/reveal-the-universe/#brief","text":"Jonathan begins with a description of Portal 2, and demonstrates discovering a game mechanic to do with using light bridges in such a way that you explore otherwise impossible-to-reach places. He also shows a classic game - vvvvvv - which allows you to change the direction of gravity for your character. Out of this single, incredibly simple rule, you can build mechanics that allow the character to traverse 180 degree bends and full circles, opening the game up into all sorts of fun and revealing mazes with just one rule. Such mechanics are: little nuggets of truth the designer has found and packaged for the player. Now, I am calling them 'truth' even though you, as a player, encounter them as pieces of a fictional game-world that doesn't exist. But, if you think carefully about these things: they are about subjects which pertain to the real world. These often reveal sophisticated understandings of the universe - likes lines intersecting in 2-D space, but being one below the other in 3 dimensions (as in Portal 2), yet in game play, it happens very naturally. This is a lot like what mathematicians do: they build higher-order constructs out of primitive \"what if?\" questions and then explore the consequences . If you learn only one thing this week, let it be this: mechanism design is about asking the most simple \"what if?\" question you can and then exploring the possibility space it implies fully. This is the aesthetic of game design: Mine nuggets of truth. Package that truth for the player. Games are both toy universes and complex mathematical systems, and mathematics is an \"unreasonably effective\" tool for understanding the universe. In particular, mathematicians seem to agree that the shortest theorems which carry the deepest consequences are the \"most beautiful.\" These are the nuggets we're looking for in the design of any mechanism.","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-5/reveal-the-universe/#exploring-well","text":"Start with a mechanic; like a grappling hook that you can shoot and pull yourself with. Or be more vague, beginning with a detail or consequence without being sure of the framework around it. For instance: a puzzle game where you know that you want players to remember a melody and recite it back at some stage, but don't know exactly how. Aim towards the richest space , explore it completely , and trace a strong boundary around it. Present the results cleanly and with the least contrivance to get closer to the truth. Marc talks about a 4-dimensional game he designed, where the mechanic is a button you can press to switch one of the dimensions. This dimensionality results in strange and wonderful connections between universes, such that you can pass through walls, or \"climb\" to rewards on them you wouldn't otherwise be able to reach. It's worth remembering May Li Khoe and Khan Academy . Great mechanism design revolves around small nuggets of truth, packaged with the least contrivance for people to find and experience themselves: much like negative numbers granting kids super powers when they adventure to the left of the number line, or the visual properties of prime numbers falling out their work on simple addition and subtraction. Mechanism design is not about making complex systems! It is about simplifying complex insights so that people can learn them intuitively through use (which is joyful), not explicitly through study (which is boring and contrived). Jonathan discusses a puzzle pattern game he made - The Witness - and the \"game-feel\" reasons which led him to certain constraints for drawing the solutions to puzzles. These range from ease of use across platforms to the aesthetic feel different rules - or the lack of them - induce. Before he even knew what the puzzles were, he had set up a system which could combine well with other mechanics . This is critical: exploration of low-level primitives yields possibility .","title":"Exploring well"},{"location":"module-5/reveal-the-universe/#virtuous-design","text":"We can define 8 criteria by which we can evaluate the \"virtue\" of different possibilities we stumble upon in our design process: Richness - adjust the mechanic(s) to get the most interesting consequences.

Add terrain to explore in those dimensions, or think about the puzzle as drawing a partition between different spaces on the constrained grid. Completeness - are there consequences we haven't found?

He's got a lot to teach us about how narratives and game theory effect asset prices. This is about the base, social layer of the human experience.\" This conversation will help you deepen your approach to: How narrative creates value Value investing and how it can be brought back with distributed ledgers Game theory and a greater appreciation of the different games we all play daily Brief The actual podcast begins at 6:42, if you're not interested in the build-up. This dialogue revolves around an idea called Epsilon Theory , which is basically game theory as it applies to other players in the context of stock markets and investing. As the saying goes in poker: you don't play the cards, you play the player. That is, the smartest move is often not necessarily to invest in the stock with the best fundamentals; it's to invest in the stock you think everyone else believes to have the best fundamentals. When everyone thinks this way, it gets even more complicated and you end up with things like Hertz or TSLA . Traditionally, we can model the return on any investment we make with the formula: y = \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b5 where y is the overall return; alpha is the excess return relative to the market; beta is essentially the market rate; and epsilon is the \"error\" or, more prosaically, \"everything else\" that doesn't fit into the traditional model. \"There is a lot that we don't understand. Just because we can't formalize it, doesn't mean that it's not real. It doesn't mean that it's error ; it means that it's outside the current scope of our thinking [...] In investing, a lot of what is left out of alpha and beta is the strategic behaviour of market participants .\" Common knowledge Dr Ben Hunt makes the claim that epsilon is the term which captures other people's behaviour . In order to demonstrate this, he cites a lesser-known game, beloved by John Maynard Keynes: the common knowledge game . Back in the day, newspapers held beauty contests where they would post 10 pictures of beautiful women and have the public write in and vote on who was the prettiest lady in the land (Level 1). However, you might be rewarded if you voted for the winner. Which means, you ought to vote not for who you actually feel is prettiest, but who you feel everyone else will vote for as prettiest (Level 2). Level 3 is everyone figuring out what everyone else thinks about who the prettiest girl is, much like the stock market today. It's a question of what the consensus about the consensus is. It's game theory for crowds! I think everyone's woken up - or been forced to realise - that the old rules don't work. Frankly, they never did: it's just that we all believed they did [...] Everyone's now thinking in terms of narrative, and playing the player in these strategic interactions, which I think is so important for understanding the real power structures in the world and what we can do to change them. Consider an island of blue-eyed people. On this island, it is taboo to a) have eyes which are not blue and b) speak of anyone's eye colour. If you have eyes which are not blue, you must leave the island the next day. Because of these conditions - even though there may be some green-eyed renegades present - there is no way of telling them, so everyone stays and lives happily together. However, one day, a missionary arrives on the island. Not bound by the same taboos, he studies the local society and then stands up on his soapbox and ruins everything by announcing that \"There are people on this island with green eyes!\" Of course, he's just saying what everyone already knows. However, now everyone knows that everyone else knows. That is, the missionary has established common knowledge. If there is only one green-eyed person, it's immediately obvious who it is, and they will leave the next day. What happens if there are two or more? Well, for n islanders with green eyes, they all leave simultaneously n days later. This process of creating common knowledge, and then all of us looking around saying, 'Am I the only one who's out of step here?' is the way markets work: nothing, nothing, nothing and then - all of a sudden - boom! Everyone with green eyes leaves. There are time and magnitude elements to the creation of common knowledge and the way it impacts a market. The more people who share the non-common view, the longer it takes to the break the narrative, but the bigger that break will be . Social uses Our ability - given the fire hose of data we are faced with every day, and the processing power we now have - to visualize the structure of crowd narratives is unprecedented. It's no mistake that the four most successful species - ants, termites, bees and humans - are all social animals. The sine qua non of what this means is existing within \"an ocean\" of intra-species communication. When we can map these narrative spaces, we can better predict and anticipate human behaviour. The question is not whether models like discounted cash flows are right or wrong; it's whether they are useful . Newton wasn't wrong, it's just that his equations have turned out to be special cases of more general phenomena. The same applies for markets and econometric theory. The conversation moves into a discussion of the 2008 crisis and the Federal Reserve as missionary , creating the narrative that they will always backstop the market via \"open market operations\" like buying the Mortgage-Backed Securities Perry Mehrling talked about . Dr Hunt points out that this really began in 2009 with the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which was a set of actions whereby they put the \"full faith and credit of the US government behind the unbacked credit of federally chartered banks\" - that is, Goldman could stand up the next day and issue $30bn of corporate debt, co-signed by the government. The pleasant skin of capitalism was ripped off in 2008 and I could see the naked sinews of power below that [...] And now again, created over that, is the new skin of narrative and missionary work - we're saving the economy . The nudge Dr Hunt speaks about the \"nudging oligarchy\" and the \"nudging state\" - that is, we don't live in 1984 with the government as jack-booted thug, crushing out all resistance. It's much more like the smiling badge with a few drops of blood from Watchmen , whose ultimate goal is self-censorship. This is Bentham's panopticon par excellence. Moreover, it is the panopticon enhanced with Moore's Law when you consider Central Bank Digital Currencies and social credit systems. Dr Hunt claims that a government is defined by control of the money supply and argues that it will co-opt the clever parts of technologies like Bitcoin to suit the ends of those in power. However, be wary when you hear people talk about the \"strategy\" of Bitcoin, or the \"intention\" of decentralized networks. Bitcoin and Ethereum have no strategy - they are means of ordering certain facts in such a way that no-one can claim ownership of either order or fact. Remember: we're not fighting the system, just abandoning it . Listen to Kevin Kelly : \"there is no them\". There is - to use Dr Hunt's own words - only one crowd trying to look in the mirror to figure out what the crowd truly thinks. The long game Perhaps the ability to exit - this notion of abandoning the system - is exactly the sort of check we need to prevent nudging states from moving too far, and exerting undue influence over the citizenry's autonomy? Dr Hunt thinks this is true, but cautions that one doesn't want to end up in the \"gold bug\" situation of sitting in a bunker hoping for a catastrophe, as it is not a pleasant state of mind in which to pass your life. There is a longer game at play here, and it doesn't take place on \"the battlefield of money\", where one is first ghetto-ized and then outlawed. Distributed ledger technologies attack the Achilles heel of the nudging nation state, by solving distributed trust . This is at the core of Dr Hunt's movement around investing and citizenship, and what Epsilon Theory is really about. Distributed trust is the Big Game TM . Let's consider three possible outcomes. Competition between nations leads to adoption of public, decentralized networks; such networks become so useful that - like TCP/IP - nation states must adopt them to stay relevant; or there is a generational narrative shift led by disenfranchised youth. Dr Hunt thinks the first two unlikely: strong nations will only compete to dethrone the Dollar if they can replace it with their own currency, and weak nations \"do what they must\" to survive. Usefulness gets co-opted such that you become just another game in the \"Wall Street casino\" and change nothing fundamental, like Rushkoff bemoaned . However, I honestly think that there is an enormous reservoir of desire for an alternative financial system or network of investors and markets and trading that is outside of the public market casino utility that we have today and that [Ethereum] has developed an integral part of that [...] There is a natural alliance, that can be cemented with the right narratives, between value investors and the disenfranchised young generations which could shake the current financial system and create something interesting. \ud83d\udca1 This is the evolution of our revolution. There is hope And it arises from linking together people from all around the world in what is known as an epistemic community - a community of knowledge. The ability to create such \"packs\" is new to the world, and it is cause for great optimism, even in the face of the power of nudging states and oligarchies. This is ultimately about finding the people who are in this world, but not of it: Good-hearted, but disaffected people, who want liberty and justice for all. Imagine that!

However, they are not personal principles and have nothing to say about our motivation as human beings for wanting to build out and participate in the Eth2 economic elder game. We'll turn to Bret Victor to help us think about how we might meaningfully merge our technical practice with a personal principle so as to live response-ably: cultivating both an awareness of that which we must uphold, protect or respond to and the ability to do so with care. How does this fit into KERNEL? This is the kernel of KERNEL. Bret won't teach you about decentralized systems; or money, finance and speech; or about what the web means in the context of a networked species. \"This is about a way of living your life which most people don't talk about. As you approach your career, you'll hear about 'following your passion', or 'doing something you love'. This is about something different: finding and following a principle . Something you believe is important and necessary and right and using that to guide what you do.\" Brief This is a talk in three parts: Bret describes his own principle, then describes some other people who have lived principled lives, and then uses both previous sections to illustrate how you can find and follow your own principle. Immediate Creation \"Bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do and great ideas - art, stories, inventions and scientific theories - take on lives of their own which give meaning to our lives as people.\" Bret is primarily concerned with what sorts of tools provide healthy environments for ideas to grow. Thus, his principle is: \ud83d\udca1 Creators need an immediate connection to what they create. What this means is that, when you're making something and you make a change or a decision, you need to see its effect directly and instantaneously. Nothing should be hidden: creators need to see what they're doing. The first place where this principle is violated is coding. Specifically, we edit code in a text editor, see what it looks like; then make some changes, compile and run it again and see the effect of that new change. Most of the time is spent working in a text editor blindly , without an immediate connection to the output. The first step is to link the two together seamlessly in one environment. Then, we can start thinking of ways to change our work other than typing new code. Bret demonstrates this by \"dialing\" numbers up an down with a simple ctrl + click mechanism, allowing you to explore the space and pick the magnitude which feels best to you artistically, without needing to go through each possible number manually. He demonstrates how this simple change allowed him to discover a means for animating the blossoms he would never have otherwise known about. So much of creation is discovery. And you can't discover anything if you can't see what you're doing [...] Having an immediate connection allows ideas to surface, and develop, in ways which were not before possible. There's still a problem though: I have the picture, and I have the code, but I have to maintain the mapping between the two in my head to make sense of things. This time, option + click allows us both to see which line draws what piece of the picture, but also what each pixel in the picture corresponds to in the code. It turns out this is also useful for navigation, allowing us to make changes as quickly as we think of them , which is critical to the creative process. \ud83d\udca1 There are thoughts we can't think: we need our tools to help us discover them. Interactivity If you have a process in time, and you want to see changes immediately; you have to map time to space [...] Creators need to be able to see what they're doing. If you're designing something embedded in time, you need to be able to see across time, otherwise you're designing blind. In the tree example, there is no state: no sense of time or interactivity. Bret shows a platform game which has all the features of the tree example above, but also can be paused at any point and rewound - in this case to adjust the future trajectory of a character's jump so they end up in exactly the right place without unnecessary fuss for the creator. As I was designing this, I noticed that it's fun to play with gravity. I bet you could make an entire game from that one mechanic. In fact, you could probably make a game from fiddling with any single line of code here as a way of exploring possibly rich mechanics . Abstract Algorithms Bret talks about binary search and demonstrates how the code for such an algorithm gives no immediate sense of what it does. You have to 'play computer' and simulate in your head what each line of code will do. To a large extent, the people who we consider to be good software developers are just those people who are good at playing computer. But if we're writing our code on a computer , why are we simulating what a computer would do rather than just having it do it and show us!? In particular, he uses this example to show how easy and intuitive it is to find different kinds of bugs - both simple ones like having an invalid array index, and non-trivial ones where the range within which we're searching becomes distorted and never returns anything usable. That is, this is \"what it looks like to write an algorithm without a blindfold on.\" Our current conception of what a program is - a list of textual definitions that you hand to a compiler - is derived from languages made in the 1950's when we were still using punch-cards. None of these languages, or the machines they ran on, were interactive - and this assumption is still with us today, even though the media has changed drastically. People still thinks REPLs are \"interactive programming\" because that was the best you could do on a teletype! Golden Rules We can demonstrate with programming and software, but the principle itself has to do with any kind of creation . Bret shows an electric circuit to illustrate the breadth of what he has in mind. In electric circuit design, we are mostly interested in the data associated with the variables, and yet traditional tools and environments confine us to static representations we must then simulate in our heads. He uses this to present the two golden rules of information design: Show the data. Show comparisons. Here's the really mind-blowing piece: instead of the representation of a circuit being made out of \"little squiggly symbols\", it is made out of data . The symbols exist because they were appropriate for the medium of pencil and paper, but when you have a new medium, you have to rethink your representations to give creators more immediate connections to what they are creating. The last example he provides is entirely outside the field of engineering, in order to demonstrate the generality of this principle. Bret shows how animation can be handled in a far more elegant way than Flash. It's really worth just watching yourself. Go to 30:50 to see it unfold. \ud83d\udca1 Immediate connection is the fertilizer we need to grow gardens of great ideas. Motivation When I see a violation of this principle, when I see creators constrained by their tools, their ideas compromised, I don't see that as an opportunity. I'm not excited by finding a problem to solve. I am not in this for the 'joy of making things'. Ideas are very precious to me, and when I see ideas dying, it hurts. I see a tragedy. To me, it feels like a moral wrong. It feels like an injustice, and I feel it is my responsibility to do something. Not opportunity: responsibility . Bret is not trying to convince you to take up his principle, but rather to highlight that the words he is using - \"responsibility\", \"injustice\", \"moral wrong\" - aren't the words you generally hear in a technical field. Things in social fields like censorship, gender discrimination, environmental degradation are all recognized as moral wrongs, yet we lack this tenor in our technical creations. The purpose of this talk is to tell you that activists are not limited to social causes. As a technologist, you can recognize a wrong in the world, you can have a vision for what a better world could be, and you can dedicate yourself to fighting for a principle. Social activists generally dedicate themselves to a principle by organizing, but you can fight for a principle by inventing . Visionaries In the late 70's at Xerox Parc, Larry Tesler and his colleagues thought that personal computing - which was not considered feasible by anyone else - had huge potential to change how people thought and lived. At the time, software interfaces were designed around modes . Vim still famously does this . By pioneering the concept of software user studies, he observed that the complexity of modes was a barrier that many people, even with training, couldn't cross. This was therefore a threat to his dream of personal computers. He made it his personal mission to get rid of modes and he formed a principle: no person should be trapped in a mode . His slogan was \"Don't mode me in!\" This principle informed everything he did and he eventually came up with a text editor called Gypsy which was the beginning of text editors as we know them today. This was a transformative change in allowing people to connect with computers. His ideas about modelessness spread to the rest of the desktop interface and today, are so ingrained in our computers, that we do not notice them [...] So, how can we describe what Larry did? Yes, he 'invented' cut-copy-paste, but this invention is very different to Thomas Edison inventing the phonograph. Edison stumbled over the technology for audio recording and built it out as a novelty, but he didn't have any cultural intent , whereas what Larry did was entirely a reaction to a particular cultural context. Can you begin to see why we have placed such emphasis on breaking down our culturally conditioned modes of thinking ? It's also not entirely accurate to say that Larry \"solved the problem\" of modeless text manipulation, because nobody else saw it as a problem! For everyone else, modes were just how computers worked - they were a fact of life. The first thing Larry did was recognize a wrong that was unacknowledged in the culture, which is how many great social changes began too. What Elizabeth Cady Stanton did in championing women's right to vote is a much closer model for what Larry actually did than the Emerson model of invention for the sake of patents. This is not a point of relative impacts, just one of motivation and approach . Both Stanton and Tesler recognized an invisible wrong. envisioned a world without that wrong, and dedicated themselves to fighting for a principle. This applies to many other seminal figures in the history of computer science. Doug Engelbart (who championed the idea of interactive computing) is best known for inventing the mouse, but he really came up with an entirely new way to work with knowledge. His explicit goal was to enable humankind to to solve the world's urgent problems. He had a vision of knowledge workers using complex, powerful information tools to harness their collective intelligence . Or Alan Kay, whose goal was \"to amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it.\" His approach was through children: if programming is a form of basic literacy, then kids will grow up to be adults who have developed new means for critical thought, and we'll have more enlightened societies. Finally: Richard Stallman, whose work on GNU now makes up a large chunk of any Linux system, and who started the Free Software Foundation, wrote GCC, GCL and many other things, and whose principle is \"software must be free, as in freedom\". Specific Insight I'm not saying that you have to live this way, or even that you should. What I am saying is that you can . That this is an option which is available to you, though it is not one which you'll hear about often [...] Instead the world will try and make you define yourself by a skill. We are conditioned to have a major in college, or a job title in our career. This can be worthwhile, and if you want to spend your life pursuing excellence by practicing a skill, you can do that. That is the path of the craftsmen: the most common path. There's also the path of the problem solver, typified by entrepreneurship or academic research, which is about choosing a problem in a given field, working on it, and making a contribution there. Or, you can define yourself not by the problem you're solving, nor by your craft, but rather by your cause ; by the principle you choose to uphold. This means having a vision and bringing the world to that vision. Be patient: it can take time to find a principle, because it is really a form of self-discovery. You're trying to figure out what your life is supposed to be about. It took Bret ten years to find his principle. His advice based on those years of wondering is: Do a lot of things. Make many things. Make many types of things. Study many things. Experience many things. Use all of these experiences as a way of analyzing yourself by asking, 'Does this resonate with me?', \"Does this repel me?', 'Do I not care?' Build up this corpus of experiences you care about and then try to make sense of it, try to figure out why you care. What is the secret ingredient in all of these experiences that I am reacting to so strongly? Confining yourself to practicing just one skill can make it difficult to get the broad range of experience which seems so valuable to doing principled work. Finally, a principle can't just be any old thing you believe in, like \"make software simpler\". These are nice thoughts, but are too vague to be directly actionable. Larry Tesler liked simplicity, but he had this specific nugget of insight that no person should be trapped in a mode. If you principle provides you with a specific insight, it will guide you, and you will always know if what you're doing is right. There are many ways to live your life: that's maybe the most important thing you can realise in life. Every aspect is a choice. But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and walk the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to. If there is something in the world you feel is wrong, and you a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle.","title":"Principled"},{"location":"module-6/inventing-on-principle/#inventing","text":"The five principles outlined in Serenity are very useful technical guidelines for designing complex systems.

Social activists generally dedicate themselves to a principle by organizing, but you can fight for a principle by inventing .","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"module-6/inventing-on-principle/#visionaries","text":"In the late 70's at Xerox Parc, Larry Tesler and his colleagues thought that personal computing - which was not considered feasible by anyone else - had huge potential to change how people thought and lived. At the time, software interfaces were designed around modes . Vim still famously does this . By pioneering the concept of software user studies, he observed that the complexity of modes was a barrier that many people, even with training, couldn't cross. This was therefore a threat to his dream of personal computers. He made it his personal mission to get rid of modes and he formed a principle: no person should be trapped in a mode . His slogan was \"Don't mode me in!\" This principle informed everything he did and he eventually came up with a text editor called Gypsy which was the beginning of text editors as we know them today. This was a transformative change in allowing people to connect with computers. His ideas about modelessness spread to the rest of the desktop interface and today, are so ingrained in our computers, that we do not notice them [...] So, how can we describe what Larry did? Yes, he 'invented' cut-copy-paste, but this invention is very different to Thomas Edison inventing the phonograph. Edison stumbled over the technology for audio recording and built it out as a novelty, but he didn't have any cultural intent , whereas what Larry did was entirely a reaction to a particular cultural context. Can you begin to see why we have placed such emphasis on breaking down our culturally conditioned modes of thinking ? It's also not entirely accurate to say that Larry \"solved the problem\" of modeless text manipulation, because nobody else saw it as a problem! For everyone else, modes were just how computers worked - they were a fact of life. The first thing Larry did was recognize a wrong that was unacknowledged in the culture, which is how many great social changes began too. What Elizabeth Cady Stanton did in championing women's right to vote is a much closer model for what Larry actually did than the Emerson model of invention for the sake of patents. This is not a point of relative impacts, just one of motivation and approach . Both Stanton and Tesler recognized an invisible wrong. envisioned a world without that wrong, and dedicated themselves to fighting for a principle. This applies to many other seminal figures in the history of computer science. Doug Engelbart (who championed the idea of interactive computing) is best known for inventing the mouse, but he really came up with an entirely new way to work with knowledge. His explicit goal was to enable humankind to to solve the world's urgent problems. He had a vision of knowledge workers using complex, powerful information tools to harness their collective intelligence . Or Alan Kay, whose goal was \"to amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it.\" His approach was through children: if programming is a form of basic literacy, then kids will grow up to be adults who have developed new means for critical thought, and we'll have more enlightened societies. Finally: Richard Stallman, whose work on GNU now makes up a large chunk of any Linux system, and who started the Free Software Foundation, wrote GCC, GCL and many other things, and whose principle is \"software must be free, as in freedom\".","title":"Visionaries"},{"location":"module-6/inventing-on-principle/#specific-insight","text":"I'm not saying that you have to live this way, or even that you should. What I am saying is that you can . That this is an option which is available to you, though it is not one which you'll hear about often [...] Instead the world will try and make you define yourself by a skill. We are conditioned to have a major in college, or a job title in our career. This can be worthwhile, and if you want to spend your life pursuing excellence by practicing a skill, you can do that. That is the path of the craftsmen: the most common path. There's also the path of the problem solver, typified by entrepreneurship or academic research, which is about choosing a problem in a given field, working on it, and making a contribution there. Or, you can define yourself not by the problem you're solving, nor by your craft, but rather by your cause ; by the principle you choose to uphold. This means having a vision and bringing the world to that vision. Be patient: it can take time to find a principle, because it is really a form of self-discovery. You're trying to figure out what your life is supposed to be about. It took Bret ten years to find his principle. His advice based on those years of wondering is: Do a lot of things. Make many things. Make many types of things. Study many things. Experience many things. Use all of these experiences as a way of analyzing yourself by asking, 'Does this resonate with me?', \"Does this repel me?', 'Do I not care?' Build up this corpus of experiences you care about and then try to make sense of it, try to figure out why you care. What is the secret ingredient in all of these experiences that I am reacting to so strongly? Confining yourself to practicing just one skill can make it difficult to get the broad range of experience which seems so valuable to doing principled work. Finally, a principle can't just be any old thing you believe in, like \"make software simpler\". These are nice thoughts, but are too vague to be directly actionable. Larry Tesler liked simplicity, but he had this specific nugget of insight that no person should be trapped in a mode. If you principle provides you with a specific insight, it will guide you, and you will always know if what you're doing is right. There are many ways to live your life: that's maybe the most important thing you can realise in life. Every aspect is a choice. But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and walk the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to. If there is something in the world you feel is wrong, and you a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle.","title":"Specific Insight"},{"location":"module-6/learn/","text":"\ud83c\udf93 Learn how to learn If \"What is value?\" was the ultimate question, then this is the holy grail.

Like the network it describes, this post will be completed in some indefinite series of stages over the next \"little while\". Please check back here periodically for at least a few years. Eth2 Design Rationale Read it How does this fit into KERNEL? In a way, this is what KERNEL has been preparing you for: what Vinay Gupta called \"unimaginable strangeness\" , wherein we deploy a global, public, decentralized and censorship-resistant computing surface which anyone can use and no-one owns. What this means for our networked species remains an open question . One thing seems clear: it is an upgrade the likes of which is only seen once in a generation at most. You'll need to recall the arguments made in value and incentives to understand the design rationale for these next few scenes of the human story . In particular, we claimed that - with blockchains - the best way to protect free speech is to price it correctly. We don't enforce \"the good\" by legal fiat and deal with exceptions like libel and hate speech through human interpretation and violent enforcement; we define what is \"bad\" and set a price on it such that malicious expression is provably more expensive than its potential effects. Eth2 extends this idea greatly: it is our generation's elder game of economic penalties. Brief Principled Layers Just as we did for KERNEL , Vitalik begins Eth2's design rational with a series of core principles: Simplicity : given the inherent complexity of such networks, this (i) minimizes development costs, (ii) reduces the risk of unforeseen security issues, and (iii) helps protocol designers to more easily convince users that parameter choices are legitimate. When complexity is unavoidable to achieve a given level of functionality, the preference order for where the complexity goes is: layer 2 protocols \u2192 client implementations \u2192 protocol spec. Long-term stability : the low levels of the protocol should ideally be built so that there is no need to change them for a decade or longer. Sufficiency : it should be possible to build any class of applications on top of the protocol. Defense in depth : the protocol should continue to work as well as possible under a variety of possible security assumptions (network latency, fault count, the motivations of users etc.) Full light-client verifiability : given some assumptions, a client verifying O(c) data should be able to gain indirect assurance that all of the data in the full system is available and valid, even under a 51% attack. In our very first note , we made the point that our way of thinking and solving problems always has to do with trade-offs. The trade-off between complexity and functionality is a deep one and goes to the heart of the debate about whether we should be innovating on layer 1 or 2. The answer is \"both\", and you need to understand your own context in order to best decide where on the spectrum your most optimal solution lies. Vitalik calls this \" functional escape velocity \": we need layer 2 solutions to ensure simplicity and long-term stability by reducing the complexity of the consensus layer; and we need layer 1 innovation in order to ensure sufficiency . In practice, this means: Quasi-Turing-complete and richly-stateful code execution , allowing robust L2 trust solutions. Scalable data availability and computation, along with Fast block times, both of which ensure that L2 is not limited to channel and Plasma-like techniques which are not general and suffer capital inefficiencies and/or mass-exit issues. There are other features deliberately left to L2: (i) privacy, (ii) high-level programming languages, (iii) scalable state storage, and (iv) signature schemes, because these features are all areas of rapid innovation, which tilts the trade-off towards ensuring we don't set some solution in the stone of our protocol spec for an area likely to develop extensively over the next 10 years. A Defender's Game Bitcoin was a major innovation - it's almost like time-travelers came back to 2009 and dropped it on an obscure mailing list for us to puzzle over. However, it is not elegant and its consensus algorithm breaks one of the fundamental advantages cryptography provides: adversarial conflict should heavily favor defenders . Sea steads are easier to destroy than build, but an average person\u2019s ECC keys are secure enough to resist even state-level actors. Systems that consider themselves ideological heirs to the cypherpunk spirit should maintain this basic property, and be much more expensive to destroy or disrupt than they are to use and maintain. Proof of Work security can only come from block rewards, and incentives to miners can only come from the risk of losing future block rewards. Proof of work necessarily operates on a logic of massive power incentivized into existence by massive rewards. It's effective, but inefficient. The cost of attack and cost of defense are at a 1:1 ratio, so there is no defender\u2019s advantage . Proof of stake breaks this symmetry by relying not on rewards for security, but rather penalties [...] The \u201cone-sentence philosophy\u201d of proof of stake is thus not \u201csecurity comes from burning energy\u201d, but rather \u201csecurity comes from putting up economic value-at-loss\u201d. Consider Amazon's algorithm and how they solved unbounded search by turning everything into a platform, only to find that advertising is intractable to platform solutions . This is because the limited number of top spots on infinite-length shelves, and the crazy amounts of revenue they generate, create a conflict of interest between Amazon and its users. This kind of conflict can only be solved with a protocol , not a platform . However, PoW protocols still have a comparable conflict of interests between miners and users. Miners must pay for the massive power they are incentivized to use in securing a PoW network, which creates both (i) consistent forced sellers in any market and (ii) skewed incentives around, for instance, block sizes which lead to sub-optimal outcomes for users of the network. Ensuring that anyone, even with entry-level hardware and a small amount of ETH, can act as a validator and that the protocol relies on penalties rather than rewards, means that users and validators are more likely to be the same people , thus reducing conflict. Just as protocols which define and encode what it means to cheat do no need to be trusted , protocols which define and encode penalties are more likely to benefit all their users . This is because encoding rewards creates inevitably skewed incentives that only accrue to the subset of network participants who are best placed to game the system required to earn them. Proving Stake Eth2 uses a slashing mechanism where a validator that is detected to have misbehaved can be penalized: in the best case ~1%, but in the worst case up to its entire deposit. This raises the cost of an attack such that we achieve the defender's asymmetry described above and overcome the validator's dilemma, i.e. lazily validating everything without properly checking each transaction. Vitalik describes why Casper FFG was chosen - it was the simplest available at the time - and how other options continue to be explored. He highlights the problem of \"supernodes\" and why sharding is better: less centralization risk, more censorship resistance, and better long-term scalability. Critically, he then considers the security models of any system we choose, and how it operates not just under the \"honest majority\" model of 51% chains, but also the uncoordinated rational majority and worst-case models. Assuming the worst-case, the question remains: Can we force the attacker to have to pay a very high cost to break the chain\u2019s guarantees? What guarantees can we unconditionally preserve? Slashing ensures the first condition, and Vitalik provides a detailed table of the guarantees we can preserve with Proof of Stake systems in this section . In a system designed around penalties, you need to distinguish between various types of validator failure - most of which are benign (like simply being offline) - and only a few of which are genuinely malicious. Critically, it is the trade-off between different penalties which informs how we structure rewards. Aligning Incentives Validators must attest to what they believe to be the head of the chain in each epoch. If they do so, they earn a base reward , which is split into 5 parts described here . There are two features to understand about this reward: how it prevents \" griefing \", and how it is calculated. Griefing occurs when an attacker seeks to reduce other validators\u2019 revenue, even at some cost to themselves, in order to encourage the victims to drop out of the mechanism (either so the attacker can get more revenue, or as part of a longer-term 51% attack). By multiplying the base fee B with P , the portion of validators that agree - and penalizing any validator who doesn't with \u2212B - we implement a collective rewards scheme where \u201cif anyone performs better, everyone performs better\u201d. This bounds the griefing factors in an optimal way and is the best example of explicitly prosocial mechanism design we know of in any blockchain. The base fee is proportional to the inverse square root of all deposits. This strikes a compromise between a fixed reward rate and a fixed total reward . The first creates too much uncertainty about both issuance and the total level of deposits; the second potentially incentivizes griefing more than can be disincentivzed by the collective scheme above. Again, mechanism design is all about balancing trade-offs . Rewards are designed this way only as a result of the thinking about how to penalize different kinds of undesirable validator behaviour. Now that we understand this premise, we can check that the rewards fit our requirements by considering the break-even uptime for any validator. If everyone is validating, you need only be online ~44.44% of the time. However, if other validators are offline - say P = - then you need to be online ~53.6% of the time. The incentives ensure that, as more validators go offline, the penalty for doing so is greater, which creates something Vitalik calls an inactivity leak . If the chain fails to finalize for more than 4 epochs, a second penalty component is added which increases quadratically over time. This: Penalizes being offline much more heavily in the case where you being offline is actually preventing blocks from being finalized and Ensures that if more than do go offline, eventually the portion online goes back up to because of the declining deposits of the offline validators. So, we can handle elegantly the penalties for common and benign kinds of validator failures, but what about actual attacks and/or malicious behaviour? If a validator is caught violating the Casper FFG slashing condition, they get penalized a portion of their deposit equal to three times the portion of validators that were penalized around the same time. A validator misbehaving is only really bad for the network if they misbehave at the same time as many other validators, so it makes sense to punish them more in that case. It heavily penalizes actual attacks, but applies very light penalties to single isolated failures that are likely to be honest mistakes. It ensures that smaller validators take on less risk than larger validators (in the normal case, a large validator would be the only one failing at the same time as themselves). It creates a disincentive against everyone joining the largest pool. Technicalities Vitalik then discusses some of the technical choices favored in the design, like BLS signatures (which are easy to aggregate) and SSZ (a simpler serialization suite which aligns with the principle of simplicity ). We'll summarize very briefly here. 32 ETH minimum deposits strike a good balance between decentralization / finality time / message overhead. This is a trade-off because the size of deposits defines the total possible number of validators (smaller deposits = more validators), which increases decentralization at the cost of message overhead, and potentially finality time. Various techniques around random sampling for different committees are discussed, including Verifiable Delay Functions and the current swap-or-not algorithm used to shuffle the validator set and assign responsibilities every epoch. The LMD GHOST fork choice rule , which incorporates information from all validators, hundreds in each slot, making it extremely unlikely in the normal case that even a single block will be reverted. The beacon chain and shard structure is described, along with reasons for not going with a different design, such as Having distinct shard chains and linking them into the beacon chain more rarely. This was rejected to allow for fast (single-slot) base-layer cross-shard communication capability. See here for more. Not having a beacon chain, and connecting shard chains to each other in some other structure. This was rejected to maintain simplicity . The hub-and-spoke beacon chain structure with a hierarchical fork choice is simpler to implement and reason about. The proof of custody game , which revolves around validators needing to produce \"period sub-keys\" such that they can prove they were not lazily verifying data. This creates a disincentive so as to overcome the validator's dilemma mentioned above. The validator lifecycle , which involves depositing, activating, exiting, withdrawing and the reason for using a more convenient construction of \"effective balance\" for validators. Finally, Vitalik describes fork choice rule - because the ability to exit the network at any stage is critical to the system's game theoretic equilibria. The Positive Sum What is Eth2? Well, we said it already: our generation's elder game of economic penalties. These penalties are the game mechanics we use to reveal a unique kind of truth : it is possible to build - and asymmetrically defend/maintain - an explicitly prosocial, global, and ownerless system that provably benefits all the people who choose to use it. The benefits of encoding penalties extend to all layers of this game, including our ability to use co-ordination costs to our advantage . Welcome. Most of us friends here, because the alternatives are more expensive.","title":"Serenely"},{"location":"module-6/serenity/#serenity","text":"You've finally reached the tranquil waters of Eth2 - congratulations!

A validator misbehaving is only really bad for the network if they misbehave at the same time as many other validators, so it makes sense to punish them more in that case. It heavily penalizes actual attacks, but applies very light penalties to single isolated failures that are likely to be honest mistakes. It ensures that smaller validators take on less risk than larger validators (in the normal case, a large validator would be the only one failing at the same time as themselves). It creates a disincentive against everyone joining the largest pool.","title":"Aligning Incentives"},{"location":"module-6/serenity/#technicalities","text":"Vitalik then discusses some of the technical choices favored in the design, like BLS signatures (which are easy to aggregate) and SSZ (a simpler serialization suite which aligns with the principle of simplicity ). We'll summarize very briefly here. 32 ETH minimum deposits strike a good balance between decentralization / finality time / message overhead. This is a trade-off because the size of deposits defines the total possible number of validators (smaller deposits = more validators), which increases decentralization at the cost of message overhead, and potentially finality time. Various techniques around random sampling for different committees are discussed, including Verifiable Delay Functions and the current swap-or-not algorithm used to shuffle the validator set and assign responsibilities every epoch. The LMD GHOST fork choice rule , which incorporates information from all validators, hundreds in each slot, making it extremely unlikely in the normal case that even a single block will be reverted. The beacon chain and shard structure is described, along with reasons for not going with a different design, such as Having distinct shard chains and linking them into the beacon chain more rarely. This was rejected to allow for fast (single-slot) base-layer cross-shard communication capability. See here for more. Not having a beacon chain, and connecting shard chains to each other in some other structure. This was rejected to maintain simplicity . The hub-and-spoke beacon chain structure with a hierarchical fork choice is simpler to implement and reason about. The proof of custody game , which revolves around validators needing to produce \"period sub-keys\" such that they can prove they were not lazily verifying data. This creates a disincentive so as to overcome the validator's dilemma mentioned above. The validator lifecycle , which involves depositing, activating, exiting, withdrawing and the reason for using a more convenient construction of \"effective balance\" for validators. Finally, Vitalik describes fork choice rule - because the ability to exit the network at any stage is critical to the system's game theoretic equilibria.","title":"Technicalities"},{"location":"module-6/serenity/#the-positive-sum","text":"What is Eth2?

Words like this have such inertia as a result of all the uses to which they have been put over the generations. They have been misused repeatedly in the service of violent and oppressive narrative structures which do not truly serve our species. There is, to quote Douglas Rushkoff, Nothing Sacred . Which also means everything is sacred. What I most want to say here cannot be said . Instead, simply recognize that you cannot acquire everything, which is why any path to the sacred (meaning beyond yourself) has always had to do with letting go. We are not on a hero's journey. We are on a fool's errand to give back the evil which does not belong in this world. Without cause, God gave you being. Without cause, give it back. The Inertia of Language Read it Ever Moving Journey How does this fit into KERNEL? We must take great care with the language we use to describe our intentions when working with a global, shared and ownerless platform for computing. This is because the plot of our narratives is actually written in economic code and executed without the context stories provide. The possibilities for the kinds of transactions we can enter into are therefore endless, but this is neither a good nor a bad thing. It is simply a (very strange) fact of the time in which we live. As Lewis Hyde showed , it is to the poets that we must turn to understand how to best craft this new tongue and use it in service of those to come, rather than our own self-aggrandizement. \"Languages are not a barrier because the melodic contour of the song describes the nature of the land over which the song passes. The rhythm is what is crucial to understanding the song. Listening to the song of the land is the same as walking on this songline and observing the land.\" Brief Marianne Br\u00fcn begins by discussing the tacit assumptions of a work on The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn, along with the claims he makes about the term \"paradigm\" and the dilemma this lands him in, which she will unpick in the course of her essay. In short: its greatest dynamic power is held by a paradigm while it is not called paradigm , but called facts, data, truth, nature, ethics, proper procedures, etc. As soon as a paradigm is called a paradigm (usually then referred to as a mere paradigm ), its power collapses. Assumed knowledge, like heliocentricism or the existence of a particular God, creates the framework for investigation. However, it has throughout most of human history been a sin and crime, punished by law, church, and community vigilance, to ask and probe whether the known was true, whether philosophical thought and scientific research and problem-solving were based on all one could know. We cannot sneer at this history, knowing that the people of bygone times acted in accordance with what they knew, and could not have suspected that much of their knowledge was based on flawed interpretations or faulty observations. Of course, this implies that We today can not tell, by definition, within which paradigm we are dwelling, thinking and acting, unless and until we are able to observe us and it from the outside, just as we recognize it and us from outside the times of Galileo. In order to bypass the problem Kuhn created for himself above, Br\u00fcn defines her stance: I shall use the word paradigm whenever I wish to speak of any structural notion and concept which, underlying the development of discourse, is tacitly taken for granted by all participants in that discourse, taken to go without saying and left unquestioned, regardless of whether the discourse leads to an agreement or a disagreement on any issue. The Inertia of Language Our history can be seen as the retroactive telling of various paradigmatic stories; their inception, flourishing, and collapse; and how there always has been a new paradigm waiting to substitute for the collapsed one. These stories do not, however, sufficiently emphasize a recurrent and ubiquitous phenomenon [...] This phenomenon is best described as the inertia of language . This inertia is both a symptom of paradigmatic stories, and the dynamic force behind their telling. It can be traced through facts like how the sun still \"rises\", even though we have known for hundreds of years that it is the Earth's horizon which dips into dawn, and rises into darkness. Due to this inertia, language stores and offers for communicative usage many remnants of many obsolete paradigms. If we accept these remnants in what we write, speak or hear, then we subject ourselves to the unstoppable inertia behind it. This is something for which we must take individual responsibility: In human society language is so powerful that only violence can stop it. Where its power fails to serve my desires, it would be a mistake to blame such failure on the weakness of language. Rather I should blame the weakness of my relation to language. If I fail to notice that I think and speak, under the influence of language, in patterns and constructs accumulated and preserved in the junkyards of long since vanished paradigms, then this shows my lack of consciousness with regard to just that power with which language can quickly make me spokesman for ideologies, in which everybody is almost always \u201cright\u201d at the \u201cwrong\u201d time. Re-cognition Ideologues always use language which insists on its own truth and consistency, yet is hostile to critique and frames the observed evidence as a betrayal of its believed premise. Ideologues believe in the power of language but fail to recognize it and so they become no more than the tools of their own ideologies: The accumulated language of bygone times: powerful, familiar, and obsolete, uses the ideologists and makes them its speakers. Through them it thwarts those specific human attempts which we call ideas and which, rebellious against all that is, would engender new thought and new procedures. This brings us to the dilemma faced by authors like Kuhn: Neither insight nor good intention, not even syntactic and grammatical care, will protect me from becoming an ideologist as long as I am unable or unwilling to create the suitable language which speaks as I think and not louder than my thoughts. Overcoming this begins by facing squarely the human misery and suffering in this world, seeing how it is largely created as a result of our culture, ethics, morals, beliefs and values and then attempting to join \"the problem-solvers\" so that we might stand ready for the day when The universal paradigm, in whose invisible and unquestioned embrace human misery can accurately be named a somehow excusable and certainly always expected commonplace, will stand exposed and rejected, to be replaced by one that I (from my present outlook) would prefer or (a radical change in social consciousness) by none. We're arguing for the replacement of the paradigm which casts human suffering as an excusable certainty with none, rather than Br\u00fcn's preference, but her following analysis is still on point. The Reward-oriented Hierarchy My conjecture is that we all live, speak, and act, perceive, judge, and decide under the unquestioned, untouchable, and firmly established guidance of an image which I call \u201cthe reward-oriented hierarchy\u201d. By calling it so, I maybe able to show that particular dynamic property of language which, undetected, blocks creative, and thus political, thought processes. Br\u00fcn makes a clear distinction between (1) the premise of any society, which is the satisfaction of all human needs before and so that (2) the purpose of society can be envisioned, which is better means to meet our needs; the use of freedom from need for enjoyment of diversity and difference; the exploration of ideas; and the implementation of inventions. We do not live in such a human society. Our society has developed an image of itself, according to which the satisfaction of needs has to be deserved and earned, so that it be understood as a reward [...] The premise of the reward-oriented hierarchy states that the necessities for the satisfaction of human needs are scarce. This scarcity poses individual and social problems of production and distribution. Finally, the premise declares that the problems of scarcity can not be solved before individual and social problems are solved. Our present knowledge and technology could remove scarcity, but its economics and language linger on. This is exactly why shared networks which merge the two explicitly and allow us to program dynamic flows of value are so fascinating. They're the only piece Br\u00fcn was missing back in 1980. She already understood then what many still do not: the problem is not primarily social or political. It is linguistic . On Your Marx We cannot use the language of this reward-oriented hierarchy in which we are so deeply embedded to discuss its own premise: we must first teach it to experiment with itself in order to discover how it labors under the paradigm it ought to expose. In particular: can we find the language whose grammar, syntax, and sentence structure would make it consistent with the premise that all human needs have to be satisfied first, before and so that individual and social problems can and will be identified and solved? Br\u00fcn quotes Karl Marx and shows how his analysis of labour may be applied to language to make a very subtle point about how insidious paradigms truly are. Though we can use Marxist analysis to reveal the contradictions of capitalism, showing that there are contradictions is not revolutionary. It is the contradictions themselves which are revolutionary because they generate the antagonisms which the system cannot resolve without disintegrating. Therefore, Marxist analysis is a great starting point, but what it lacks - and what Br\u00fcn dreams of - is a fundamentally economic language largely free from the accumulated inertia of past paradigms. Measured Art If we are to live up to Br\u00fcn's dream of a society which solves human need as its premise, we must become the creative artists who compose language to teach its writers and speakers how to be thoughtfully and carefully inconsistent with undesirable premises, to be incompatible with the morals, the religions, the armed forces, the arguments of the reward-oriented hierarchy. This kind of dream cannot be realised in natural language, no matter how eloquent: Communicative language is accumulated language based on obsolete and present paradigms and can not speak for those of us who think and dream in another paradigm. Because all of these briefs form one, connected chain of thought - a digital songline of a different and human society - Br\u00fcn finishes with a note about doubt, humility and art : Language is not the standard against which thinking is to be measured; on the contrary: language is to be measured by a standard it barely reaches, if ever, namely the imagery of human doubt and human desire [...] If the imagery succeeds in containing, anti-communicatively, for later, the simulation, the structural analogy to that which was found wanting, then, who knows, it may tell us or someone some day with breathtaking eloquence and in then simple terms what we, today, almost speechlessly have wanted so much.","title":"Of No Paradigm"},{"location":"module-7/no-paradigm/#no-paradigm","text":"One concern in putting this module together has been language itself - in particular the word \"sacred\".

Brief Gregory Chaitin discusses Umberto Eco's book The Search for the Perfect Language , and how it relates to some deep concepts in mathematics, coupled with a non-standard view on intellectual history. He begins by asking, What is the perfect language? [... It is] the language whose structure directly expresses the structure of the world, in which concepts are expressed in their direct, original format. He discusses some of the early figures of this search, including Raymond Lull and Gottfried Leibniz. Though both grounded in magical and theological thinking - as well as alchemy and hermeticism - it was Leibniz who first formulated the search in a modern way, calling this language the characteristica universalis. A crucial part of this language was something he called the calculus ratiocinator , by which we can reduce reasoning to calculation and thereby elide the need for opinonated arguments in favour of pure computation. It was this notion which led him to develop calculus. Leibniz's version was slightly different from Newton's, in that his focus was specifically on the notation and formalism: i.e. how can we generate the most expressive power from the smallest set of meaningful symbols? His calculus presents a fundamentally mechanistic approch to proof, as Leibniz saw clearly the importance of having a formalism that led you automatically to the answer. Set and Setting Chaitin then describes the theory of infinite sets as mathematical theology : Cantor\u2019s goal was to understand God. God is transcendent. The theory of infinite sets has a hierarchy of bigger and bigger infinities, the alephs, the \u2135\u2019s. These sets go on forever, as you can always make a new set out of the set of all previous sets, or by taking a union of all the members of an infinite sequence to get ever greater infinities. However, this leads to a contradiction, discovered by Bertrand Russell and now called the Russell paradox: if we take the universal set - the set of everything - and then consider the set of all subsets in it, then this set of all subsets must necessarily be bigger than the universal set. But how can this be? The set of all subsets of the universal set can neither be in itself nor not be in itself - which poses a problem for mathematicians who are not theologically inclined. While this contradiction never bothered Cantor - who took the view that it\u2019s paradoxical for a finite being to try to comprehend a transcendent, infinite being, so paradoxes are fine - it led Russell to expose numerous contradictions in mathematical reasoning. As a response to this, another mathematician called Davild Hilbert developed a completely formal axiomatic theory, which is a modern version of Leibniz\u2019s characteristica universalis and calculus ratiocinator . Axiomatic theories are written not in natural language with its ambiguity and informal reasoning, but in precise, artificial languages based on mathematical logic which specifies the rules of the game precisely. Empty and Incomplete The dream that there is a finite set of axioms which allowed us, in principle, to deduce all mathematical truth led to some truly beautiful work, in particular Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory and von Neumann integers. Baruch Spinoza had a philosophical system in which the world is built out of only one substance, and that substance is God, that\u2019s all there is. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory is similar. Everything is sets, and every set is built out of the empty set. That\u2019s all there is: the empty set, and sets built starting with the empty set. However, G\u00f6del and Turing showed in the 1930's that you can\u2019t have a perfect language or a formal axiomatic theory for all of mathematics because of incompleteness. G\u00f6del began with the statement \"This statement is unprovable\" and proceeded to show how the paradox at the heart of this (using G\u00f6del numbering ) reveals that we cannot capture all mathematical truth in any theory. Turing derived incompleteness from a more fundamental phenomenon: Turing\u2019s insight in 1936 was that incompleteness, that G\u00f6del found in 1931, for any formal axiomatic theory, comes from a deeper phenomenon, which is uncomputability. Incompleteness is an immediate corollary of uncomputability, a concept which does not appear in G\u00f6del\u2019s 1931 paper. The fact that G\u00f6del's incompleteness is a result of uncomputability suggests that, while there is no perfect mathematical language, there are perfect languages for certain computations . What Turing discovered in 1936 is that there\u2019s a kind of completeness called universality and that there are universal Turing machines and universal programming languages [... that is,] a language in which every possible algorithm can be written. Algorithms and Information Chaitin goes on the describe his own work in Algorithmic Information Theory, which derives incompleteness from an extreme form of uncomputability, called algorithmic irreducibility. A deeper understanding of the mathematically irreducible information contained in the Halting Problem allows us to pick out, from Turing\u2019s universal languages, maximally expressive programming languages, which are maximally compact. AIT is really about deducing the size of the smallest program required to calculate something, which allows us to create \"better\" notions of perfection, defined in terms of conciseness. The most expressive languages are the ones with the smallest programs. This definition of complexity is dry and technical. But let me put this into medieval terminology, which is much more colorful. What we\u2019re asking is, how many yes/no decisions did God have to make to create something?\u2014which is obviously a rather basic question to ask, if you consider that God is calculating the universe [...] God will naturally use the most perfect, most powerful programming languages, when he creates the world, to build everything. These most powerful programming languages can be expressed succinctly in AIT by considering a particular class of universal Turing machines U , and the most efficient ways for these machines to be universal. Chaitin describes some of the ways we have of calculating this, which extend more deeply in the details of AIT than this brief will go. What's most relevant is how we can define programs in self-delimiting ways . That is, how can we get our universal Turing machine U to know when a program has ended without adding an extra symbol (i.e. just using 0 and 1, no blanks); or extra information about the size of the program to the program itself, thereby making any computation less concise than the ideal. Just Write These self-delimiting binary languages are the ones that the study of program-size complexity has led us to discriminate as the ideal languages, the most perfect languages. We got to them in two stages, 1960s AIT and 1970s AIT. These are languages for computation, for expressing algorithms, not for mathematical reasoning. They are universal programming languages that are maximally expressive, maximally concise. What does this mean for the search for a perfect language? Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag. Hilbert's formal axiomatic theory meant to establish all mathematical truth is necessarily incomplete, and all formal reasoning has been proven to have a limit. However, There are perfect languages for computing . We have universal Turing machines and universal programming languages, and although languages for reasoning cannot be complete, these universal programming languages are complete. Furthermore, AIT has picked out the most expressive programming languages, the ones that are particularly good to use for a theory of program-size complexity. Practically speaking, the search for the perfect language has yielded some truly fascinating results. Theoretically, it has shown that mathematics contains infinite irreducible complexity and so there is no hope of finding a simple and elegant Theory of Everything like Hilbert imagined. That dream turned out to be a golem, but from the perspective of the Middle Ages, I would say that the perfect languages that we\u2019ve found have given us some magical, God-like power, which is that we can breathe life into some inanimate matter. Observe that hardware is analogous to the body, and software is analogous to the soul, and when you put software into a computer, this inanimate object comes to life and creates virtual worlds.

If you just sold these things to one another, it would have the same effect.\" This destroys the community. Perhaps we can reverse the above by building tools which allow us to present the commercial economy with the same dictum: \"You know, logically, you could turn this into a gift economy. If you program reciprocal loops and recursive incentives, it would have the same effect,\" thereby discovering again what was old community in new form ... How does this fit into KERNEL? There are many types of transactional exchange humans can enter into, and nearly all of them are required in a fully functional and healthy society. This talk has been selected because Lewis Hyde provides a balanced perspective on the place and importance of gift exchange within an economy, emphasizing the kinds of work and contexts in which it is most appropriate. It should help you understand that this is not an idealistic module: it is again a question of trade-offs . The argument is not that we should abandon any kind of economic activity other than gift-giving; simply that gifts are the opposite extreme from purely commercial transactions and that we need to think carefully about where on the spectrum of possibility between our work best fits. Brief I had been introduced to the anthropology of gift exchange as a kind of economy and it struck me almost immediately that this was a language which could be used to talk about the situation of creative artists. Hyde talks about his own biography and the notion that poetry, in particular, might have a different economy and the series of questions this led him to: Why don't creative artists earn a living the way lawyers, doctors and computer scientists do? Why do many artists feel a barrier between their work and the commercial world? The anthropology suggests that there is an ethic, and therefore a set of obligations, which come with a gift. So, if you are a gifted person and are born with talents that are clearly not just created by your own efforts, but have been endowed upon you, are there obligations that come with that, and things that you're supposed to do with your gift? Do communities have obligations to people who have been gifted in one way or another? Connection, Circulation, Spirit Hyde set out to read the anthropology, and many fairy tales and folk stories, about gift exchange. He came to three conclusions about gift-giving which differentiate it from market exchange. Gift giving creates a connection between giver and receiver. Gifts induce gratitude, and a consequent obligation towards relationship. This is the cardinal difference between gift and market exchange: part of the great virtue of the marketplace is that there is no enduring connection . Lewis gives as an example his travel to this presentation: his very mobility is enabled as a result of the lack of relationships he needs to form. Gift exchange does not allow us to participate in this disconnected fashion. \"This is a useful way to begin to think about the commerce of the creative spirit.\" Gift exchange traditionally has much wider circulations than just that passed between two individuals, especially when gifts are given anonymously. Hyde quotes an Indian story of two women who decide to dispense with their alms-giving duties by only giving gifts to each other and who are consequently reincarnated as two wells with poisonous water. Another example is Thomas Hutchinson's phrase \"Indian givers\", arising from Puritan encounters with Native Americans who had a different sense of what property is. For these people, when you gave someone something, it wasn't theirs to keep: they had to pass it on. This perplexed the Puritans and so the phrase has come to mean someone who is insincere about gift-giving, but it clearly means the opposite : someone who understands the actual ethic of gift-giving, which is that gifts flow through you, they are not yours to own . You are their custodian. In fact, one functional definition of community is \"a place where gift exchange can operate\". When property circulates as a gift, it increases in value , or it bestows liveliness . \"There is some sense of increase, or of something gaining life as it circulates.\" Hyde talks about the fairy tale trope of being given seemingly worthless objects while traveling through the Land of Fairie , only to wake up the next morning and see that they are gold. \"What seemed worthless in one community and state, turns out to be valuable in another community and state.\" The folktales tell of two responses: there are those who try to go back and get more, or figure out the price and cash in; and there are those who give the gift on. For the person who begins to count, to reckon the value of the gift; it turns back into ashes. For the other person, life becomes more lively. \"There's a kind of trans-substantiation, or morality, implied in how you treat a gift.\" Like Graeber , Hyde tells a Maori story in which the bounty of the forest from which you gather food is assumed to be a gift from nature and you must give part of it back to the forest, which is called \" feeding the spirit of the gift . If you feed the spirit, all will stay lively and in motion\". Poetic Gifts to Posterity There are poets whose lives matter to me; the fact that there are poets who have given their life to poetry matters to me; the fact that their work had entered my life was important and I felt gratitude towards these people for giving their lives to the work. Gratitude is a sign that, at some level, a gift has been given and received. Many poets talk in this way about their practice. Eugenio Montale wrote in an essay about Dante: True poetry is always in the nature of a gift, in that it presupposes the dignity of its recipient. Czeslaw Milosz wrote an essay about the different kinds of love described in Greek, in particular one type which is not often remembered: storge . This word denotes a tender care or affection uniting parents and children, and perhaps some teachers and their pupils. Milosz writes It is also not impossible that storge may be applied to the relationship between a poet and a generation of readers to come. Beneath the ambition to perfect one's art, without hope of being rewarded by contemporaries, lurks a magnanimity of gift-offering to posterity. The idea that your work is not confined to the present moment and that you're working for some kind of larger, human world is wonderfully motivating. Lewis mentions a story about Bob Dylan from \" Common As Air \", his book about about creative cultural commons which we all co-own. When Dylan was 18, he was introduced by a friend to Woody Guthrie, who he quickly learnt to imitate perfectly. Dylan says: \"Listening to Guthrie made me feel more like myself than ever before.\" This is a perplexing statement, because what is the self such that a young person would feel like himself in the presence of somebody else's art? It's as if that self is already present, but isn't brought to the surface until the art of some previous generation precipitates it [...] There is a feeling that there is a common Self, that the hyper-individualism we live with today is not a full enough story to explain how an artist becomes an artist and comes to practice with his or her gifts. Anonymous and Lively Hyde continues this theme with a story about Pablo Neruda, who - as a boy - was gifted a unique toy sheep anonymously, through a hole in the fence. He responded with his most precious possession: a pine cone. Years later, he would write these haunting words: To feel the affection that comes from those unknown to us, who are watching over our sleep and our solitude, over our dangers and our weaknesses: that is something still greater and more beautiful because it widens out the boundaries of our being and unites all living things. This exchange brought home to me, for the first time, a precious idea: that all humanity is somehow together. It won't surprise you, then, that I have attempted to give something resiny, earth-like and fragrant - something like a pine cone - in exchange for human brotherhood [...] This small and mysterious exchange of gifts remained deep inside me, deep and indestructible, giving my poetry light. This points to a particular category of gift-exchange: the anonymous one. Often we know who has given us a gift, so we have a directed sense of gratitude. Anonymity widens the field within which gifts operate, because if there is no obligation for reciprocity, how do you best respond? \ud83d\udca1 Gifts from beyond your sphere of influence can be given back beyond your sphere of influence. In almost all traditional gift-giving practices - as seen with the Maori practice of 'feeding the spirit of the gift' - the ultimate sphere of gift-giving is the bounty of nature herself, with regards to whom we all stand as recipients. In order to maintain and increase the value of the gifts we receive, we must treat them as gifts and give them on so that they remain lively . This is directly applicable to creative artists. May Sarton wrote: There is only one real deprivation, and that is not to be able to give one's gift to whom one loves the most. The gift turned inward, unable to be given, becomes a heavy burden, even sometimes a kind of poison. It is as though the flow of life were backed up. Hyde also quotes the famous book Black Elk Speaks , which begins with dedication that illustrates how whatever wisdom Black Elk has is not his , and that - if you find it in his book - it is there to be given back to his ancestors. What is good in this book is given back to the six grandfathers. This dedicated way of living contains a description of people who are \"living the spirit of the gift\", not trying to capitalize upon it, or bring it into the ego and claim it for their own. However, it is important to note that both are options and there is a negative side to gift-giving which can uphold oppressive structures and solidify - for instance - patriarchal power. Tricky Trades Hyde recalls The Homeric Hymn to Hermes , the original trickster, in which the key moment occurs when Hermes - having stolen Apollo's cattle, and being admonished by his mother - makes the point that if Zeus won't give him his due as an Olympian, he will steal it. All gift exchange communities are somewhat insular and, if you're excluded, your only practical option is to steal what you need. The key question is thus: how does the outsider find a way in ? There is another ancient Greek term which can help us here: the hermion , or gift of Hermes. It is the lucky find, the accident, the thing you stumble upon. It is the crossroads moment where two paths come together and, if you have the wit, you can make a work of art out of the accidental find. This is why cultivating serendipitous, synchronous spaces is so important: they allow more and more outsiders to join the community of circulating gift exchange without resorting to theft. What Can We Do With All This? Just to become conscious of gift exchange is useful. To know that there is a spirit of the gift. To know there is a distinction between the 'connecting world' and the world that differentiates between people, and that we can choose to honour this spirit or not. To know we might have the kind of artistic practice which can initiate transformations in the soul; that can give us a taste of mystery and wilderness; that can help us bear our suffering; that can put us in touch with a kind of fertility which is not exhausted by using it up and that offers us a sense of an inhabitable world in which we have solidarity with what we take to be the source of our gifts. To be conscious of this makes a difference . I will go a step further than Hyde: to ask what can be done with a gift and the knowledge of how it operates is to apply an alienating and utilitarian framework to something indigenous and illegible . It reminds me of Muriel Rukeyser: But there is one kind of knowledge \u2014 infinitely precious, time-resistant more than monuments, here to be passed between the generations in any way it may be: never to be used. And that is poetry. or Steve Biko: A visitor to someone\u2019s house is always met with the question \u2018What can I do for you?\u2019. This attitude to see people not as themselves but as agents for some particular function is foreign to us. We are not a suspicious race. We believe in the inherent goodness of man. We enjoy man for himself. We regard our living together not as an unfortunate mishap warranting endless competition among us but as a deliberate act of God to make us a community of brothers and sisters jointly involved in the quest for composite answers to the varied problems of life. One Last Link Gift-giving extends deeply into both history and the human psyche. If you enjoyed this talk, you can find perhaps the ultimate exposition on this particular issue in The Diamond Sutra: And again, O Subh\u00fbti, a Bodhisattva should in such wise give his gift for the benefit of all beings. And why? Because, O Subh\u00fbti, the idea of a being is no-idea. And those who are thus spoken of by the Tath\u00e2gata as all beings are indeed no-beings. The Diamond Cutter Read it","title":"The Gift"},{"location":"module-7/the-gift/#the-gift","text":"One of the tragedies of modern life occurs when people go into aboriginal communities where there is a lively gift exchange and say, 'You know, logically, you could turn this into a commercial economy. If you just sold these things to one another, it would have the same effect.\" This destroys the community. Perhaps we can reverse the above by building tools which allow us to present the commercial economy with the same dictum: \"You know, logically, you could turn this into a gift economy. If you program reciprocal loops and recursive incentives, it would have the same effect,\" thereby discovering again what was old community in new form ...","title":"\ud83c\udf81 The Gift"},{"location":"module-7/the-gift/#how-does-this-fit-into-kernel","text":"There are many types of transactional exchange humans can enter into, and nearly all of them are required in a fully functional and healthy society. This talk has been selected because Lewis Hyde provides a balanced perspective on the place and importance of gift exchange within an economy, emphasizing the kinds of work and contexts in which it is most appropriate. It should help you understand that this is not an idealistic module: it is again a question of trade-offs . The argument is not that we should abandon any kind of economic activity other than gift-giving; simply that gifts are the opposite extreme from purely commercial transactions and that we need to think carefully about where on the spectrum of possibility between our work best fits.","title":"How does this fit into KERNEL?"},{"location":"module-7/the-gift/#brief","text":"I had been introduced to the anthropology of gift exchange as a kind of economy and it struck me almost immediately that this was a language which could be used to talk about the situation of creative artists. Hyde talks about his own biography and the notion that poetry, in particular, might have a different economy and the series of questions this led him to: Why don't creative artists earn a living the way lawyers, doctors and computer scientists do? Why do many artists feel a barrier between their work and the commercial world? The anthropology suggests that there is an ethic, and therefore a set of obligations, which come with a gift. So, if you are a gifted person and are born with talents that are clearly not just created by your own efforts, but have been endowed upon you, are there obligations that come with that, and things that you're supposed to do with your gift? Do communities have obligations to people who have been gifted in one way or another?","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-7/the-gift/#connection-circulation-spirit","text":"Hyde set out to read the anthropology, and many fairy tales and folk stories, about gift exchange. He came to three conclusions about gift-giving which differentiate it from market exchange. Gift giving creates a connection between giver and receiver. Gifts induce gratitude, and a consequent obligation towards relationship. This is the cardinal difference between gift and market exchange: part of the great virtue of the marketplace is that there is no enduring connection . Lewis gives as an example his travel to this presentation: his very mobility is enabled as a result of the lack of relationships he needs to form. Gift exchange does not allow us to participate in this disconnected fashion. \"This is a useful way to begin to think about the commerce of the creative spirit.\" Gift exchange traditionally has much wider circulations than just that passed between two individuals, especially when gifts are given anonymously. Hyde quotes an Indian story of two women who decide to dispense with their alms-giving duties by only giving gifts to each other and who are consequently reincarnated as two wells with poisonous water. Another example is Thomas Hutchinson's phrase \"Indian givers\", arising from Puritan encounters with Native Americans who had a different sense of what property is. For these people, when you gave someone something, it wasn't theirs to keep: they had to pass it on. This perplexed the Puritans and so the phrase has come to mean someone who is insincere about gift-giving, but it clearly means the opposite : someone who understands the actual ethic of gift-giving, which is that gifts flow through you, they are not yours to own . You are their custodian. In fact, one functional definition of community is \"a place where gift exchange can operate\". When property circulates as a gift, it increases in value , or it bestows liveliness . \"There is some sense of increase, or of something gaining life as it circulates.\" Hyde talks about the fairy tale trope of being given seemingly worthless objects while traveling through the Land of Fairie , only to wake up the next morning and see that they are gold. \"What seemed worthless in one community and state, turns out to be valuable in another community and state.\" The folktales tell of two responses: there are those who try to go back and get more, or figure out the price and cash in; and there are those who give the gift on. For the person who begins to count, to reckon the value of the gift; it turns back into ashes. For the other person, life becomes more lively. \"There's a kind of trans-substantiation, or morality, implied in how you treat a gift.\" Like Graeber , Hyde tells a Maori story in which the bounty of the forest from which you gather food is assumed to be a gift from nature and you must give part of it back to the forest, which is called \" feeding the spirit of the gift . If you feed the spirit, all will stay lively and in motion\".","title":"Connection, Circulation, Spirit"},{"location":"module-7/the-gift/#poetic-gifts-to-posterity","text":"There are poets whose lives matter to me; the fact that there are poets who have given their life to poetry matters to me; the fact that their work had entered my life was important and I felt gratitude towards these people for giving their lives to the work. Gratitude is a sign that, at some level, a gift has been given and received. Many poets talk in this way about their practice. Eugenio Montale wrote in an essay about Dante: True poetry is always in the nature of a gift, in that it presupposes the dignity of its recipient. Czeslaw Milosz wrote an essay about the different kinds of love described in Greek, in particular one type which is not often remembered: storge . This word denotes a tender care or affection uniting parents and children, and perhaps some teachers and their pupils. Milosz writes It is also not impossible that storge may be applied to the relationship between a poet and a generation of readers to come. Beneath the ambition to perfect one's art, without hope of being rewarded by contemporaries, lurks a magnanimity of gift-offering to posterity. The idea that your work is not confined to the present moment and that you're working for some kind of larger, human world is wonderfully motivating. Lewis mentions a story about Bob Dylan from \" Common As Air \", his book about about creative cultural commons which we all co-own. When Dylan was 18, he was introduced by a friend to Woody Guthrie, who he quickly learnt to imitate perfectly. Dylan says: \"Listening to Guthrie made me feel more like myself than ever before.\" This is a perplexing statement, because what is the self such that a young person would feel like himself in the presence of somebody else's art? It's as if that self is already present, but isn't brought to the surface until the art of some previous generation precipitates it [...] There is a feeling that there is a common Self, that the hyper-individualism we live with today is not a full enough story to explain how an artist becomes an artist and comes to practice with his or her gifts.","title":"Poetic Gifts to Posterity"},{"location":"module-7/the-gift/#anonymous-and-lively","text":"Hyde continues this theme with a story about Pablo Neruda, who - as a boy - was gifted a unique toy sheep anonymously, through a hole in the fence. He responded with his most precious possession: a pine cone. Years later, he would write these haunting words: To feel the affection that comes from those unknown to us, who are watching over our sleep and our solitude, over our dangers and our weaknesses: that is something still greater and more beautiful because it widens out the boundaries of our being and unites all living things. This exchange brought home to me, for the first time, a precious idea: that all humanity is somehow together. It won't surprise you, then, that I have attempted to give something resiny, earth-like and fragrant - something like a pine cone - in exchange for human brotherhood [...] This small and mysterious exchange of gifts remained deep inside me, deep and indestructible, giving my poetry light. This points to a particular category of gift-exchange: the anonymous one. Often we know who has given us a gift, so we have a directed sense of gratitude. Anonymity widens the field within which gifts operate, because if there is no obligation for reciprocity, how do you best respond? \ud83d\udca1 Gifts from beyond your sphere of influence can be given back beyond your sphere of influence.
