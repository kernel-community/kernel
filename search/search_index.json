Each module is made up of two sections: Crafted Reading , which we will expect you to have read before the beginning of each new week; and Curated Material which is made up of articles, videos, and the occasional podcast that we highly recommend you go over before the Fireside Chat each week. Structure Crafted Reading is made up of 2 separate lessons: a \"personal\" lesson designed to teach you one of the principles we believe are important for your own navigation of this new and wild web; and a \"web 3\" lesson which is more technical and goes to the heart of critical concepts which we often don't reflect upon enough, like \"Trust\", \"Value\" and \"Freedom\". The Crafted Reading is specifically not long and hopefully not boring. It should take you a maximum of 5 minutes to read each piece, so we only expect 10 minutes of reading before the beginning of each week. The ideas each piece presents are not \"the truth\" - they are intended to get you thinking so that you can come to your own unique conclusions about a wide range of critical topics. Curated Material is specifically not a long list of links no-one will ever have the time truly to reflect upon. We have picked at most 3 pieces for each week, in different formats (video, text, audio), and we have written very detailed briefs for each piece. This is because we don't want to flood you with information; we want to teach you how to find the best information and then genuinely use it to transform your own skills, understanding and general approach to thinking about and building decentralized systems and tools. We highly recommend that you at least familiarise yourself with each brief. Timing and talking Weeks begin on Tuesdays , because part of what we're doing here is breaking down our conditioned, culturally-acquired ways of thinking. What is more conditioning than the days of the week? Free yourself from Julian hegemony! \ud83d\ude09 Our Fireside Chat, which is when we'll bring in esteemed speakers from across the industry and introduce you to the most experienced and brilliant minds we know, will generally occur each Thursday. Fireside chats revolve specifically around the theme for that week. They will be fairly structured, and broadcast live on YouTube for you to watch, with a live chat to ask questions if there is time. As you'll see in this module, though, conversations are critical to KERNEL and the framework for learning which we're presenting here. So, throughout the course of each week, we will also have a number of Juntos - smaller, break-off conversations on a variety of themes, each hosted by a an expert in that particular field. You must sign-up for these Juntos - we can accommodate at most 12 people, otherwise the conversations lose the intimacy and coherence which is their main purpose. If you don't sign up in time for a Junto you'd really like to attend, don't stress! They will also be broadcast live on YouTube, so you'll get to see the conversation happening in real-time, you just won't be able to participate actively in each one. The speakers and mentors who host these Juntos will also be around in our chat channels, so you can direct your questions to them outside the allocated time for that specific gathering.","title":"Intro to KERNEL"},{"location":"module-0/#module-0-an-introduction-to-kernel","text":"KERNEL is an 8 week program, and we'll be covering a new learning module each week.

How does this fit into KERNEL? There are many important takeaways here for the conversations we will be having in KERNEL Juntos, and beyond. \"The quality of listening determines the quality of speaking.\" \"When people are listening, I'm compelled to speak more truth.\" We should aspire to positive sum, horizontal conversations (9:14 in the video). Horizontal conversations: interactive dialogue among peers. Participants share trust, living within the same context. Conversations continue and can be picked up tomorrow, or next week, or sometime later. Much more meaning is shared. \"I have a lot of respect for people who think as they speak, and who pause to think and to attach the meaning that matters .\" Vertical conversations: Each person speaks to get their point in \u2014 not building upon each other. It becomes a competition because you are thinking of what to say instead of listening. It doesn't allow one to hear, or to speak truthfully. Less meaning is shared. Asking better questions by listening more deeply What kinds of speech really carry value ? Brief \"We live in a world where it's become the fashion to just drop these cute one-liners at each other and think then that we know things. We ask questions without really wanting the answer - all we're seeking is a quick-fix; a conceptual solution to a curiosity that doesn't really matter because it's just a passing fancy. We don't live in a world where we have conversations about things that really matter! I mean endless explorations of the truth outside of ourselves...\" What is the truth outside yourself? How could you build open tools that encourage people to explore such ideas and connect in truly meaningful ways? \"We have a thousand alternatives for every fundamental, and we spend much of our lives preoccupied with those alternatives. Our lives therefore tend to be far more incidentally bound, rather than fundamentally related . In this we express our separation: from the natural world, from the fundamentals, from the cosmos.\" This is a profound linguistic play: we all find ourselves caught up in seemingly insignificant tasks which consistenly get in the way of that really profound thing you've been meaning to learn or do. Why is this? How can we move more of our daily existence into that which is not bound and imprisoned in trivialities, but rather fundamentally related to everything around us? Isn't that what a web does? \"I missed True Voice \". What is True Voice? Have you ever heard it? \"People listen. There are pauses between speaking which are filled with thinking, and with understanding.\" How comfortable are you with silence? Is this actually not the measure of companionship - how comfortable the silences are? \"Modern conversation doesn't give space for the words to settle in the listener [...] I have a lot of respect for people who think as they speak, and who pause to think and to attach the meaning that matters .\" How can you cultivate the space within yourself required to listen well? What does it really mean to attach conscious meaning to the words you say or write? How is this amplified when those words are executable code? \"One's speaking must be shaped by the quality of the listener. So, when you're listening to me I am compelled to speak more sense. I am compelled to speak more truth.

You either have water, or you do not have water. And in between is nothing.\" What are the fictional longings in your life? How could you get to their opposite to see how hollow fear and longing really are? \"Modern humanity does not learn by being gifted. Our path is different. We're constituted to ask questions. For us, knowing is something that is achieved through effort, out of free will. The task of the modern human being is to clearly and definitively seek and find knowledge.

How can we cultivate more of that in our lives, and how can we build products which help \"every human soul take [even a] single step\" closer to their own truths? \"More and more I see the value of human conversation: the value of what arises between us when we speak in truth with what we have and what we seek.

Andreas was one of the first, and remains perhaps the most famous, presenter of Bitcoin and the ideas which inform it. Many of his talks and presentations have already become cultural artifacts. How does this fit into KERNEL? This talk provides an historical context for money and outlines why Bitcoin is important within that context. It has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Money and speech , and how closely interwoven these two have always been. Value in the broadest and most historical sense, with many pertinent examples provided. Meaning : this is not about money for the internet: it's about the internet of money. Brief Briefs present the most relevant quotes from the linked resource, with small pieces of added commentary where appropriate. \"If you think of money as technology, how old is this technology? [...] It's always surprising that people will say, 'Oh, 400 years old', '1000 years old', 'a few thousand years old'. In fact, we don't know how old money is [...] We have yet to discover a civilization that didn't have money. So, we know it's at least as old as civilization. One thing that really surprises people is that money is older than writing . The way we know this is that the first examples of writing [cuneiform and hieroglyphics] we have are writing about money - they're ledgers. Is writing older than the wheel? I don't know, but we do know that wheels were used as money. Money is an ancient technology .\" It's no small thing to talk about \"building better money\" because what we're actually talking about is a human symbolic construction which extends back beyond recorded history. Every time there has been a significant innovation in how money is expressed and/or used, very interesting things have happened to both the ways in which, and the scale at which, humans organize. \"Primates can be taught to use money: i.e. there are studies which show that you can teach them that specific stones can be exchanged for bananas. Very quickly, they invent both armed robbery and prostitution. What does this tell you about the nature of money? The important insight is that money is a form of communication . At it's very basic level, money isn't value: money represents an abstraction of value. It's a way of communicating value . Money is a language .\" If money is a language, what does an innovation which makes its medium logically decentralized really mean? It may mean that no-one will control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no-one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use. What will you choose to say in this ancient language we are revitalizing? \"Communicating value to each other is the basis of creating social bonds. Money is an important social tool .\" Money as linguistic technology is (and always has been) about the scale at which you can play your co-ordination game. The scale is now planetary. Are you ready to make your move? \"Think about how often the technology of money has been transformed. Very basically, communicating value can take place through an exchange of things of equal value. The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. And then nothing for a few thousand years. Then came the idea that I can deposit my gold with someone trustworthy; they can issue a paper certificate for my deposit; and I can trade that paper. With every technological revolution in money, there comes skepticism; and this is the moment of greatest skepticism in our history. The move to paper was highly controversial. It took about 400 years for paper as money to become broadly accepted. Then, 60 years ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards were paper, but then Diner's Club in the US created the first recognizable credit card (which was originally a form of a traveler's cheque). Now we have Bitcoin which represents a new form of 'doing money' and is as radical as the change from precious metals to paper, perhaps even more so. This is because our history as a species has to do with tangible expressions of wealth, and now we're dealing with a network-centric form of money which is totally abstract.\" We're really looking at a phase change in the expressive power of money: i.e. it can now be programmed to do stuff dynamically in addition to being traded. Think about this for a while and reconsider what it really means to write a smart contract in light of all this history. \"Bitcoin isn't just digital money (we already have that). Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation in the technology of money . So, let's talk about network architecture, because Bitcoin isn't happening in a vacuum; it's happening at a moment in history when we are seeing a transformation in many social institutions; i.e. the network-centric era. The internet has precipitated the change of many closed, hierarchical organizations and institutions into platforms . We've started seeing the introduction of interfaces - APIs - where information can flow in and out of the organization. Now, even more transformation is occurring with the change from platforms to protocols ; the difference being that, in protocols, there is no central appeal. TCP/IP doesn't work with reference to a service provider; TCP/IP works, without context , everywhere in the world. You don't have to sign up for an account, you just have to use the language . Once you go from a platform to a language, it creates a host of new possibilities. Bitcoin is the first, network-centric, protocol for money and what that means is that it exists without reference to an institution or platform. Once you've understood that money is a language used since time immemorial to communicate value, and that 2009 saw a phase shift from controlled, closed platforms to open, permissionless protocols; you've got the whole thing. What matters now is the precedents we set as the first users of these new protocols. \"'Peer-to-peer' money refers to an architecture which describes the relationship between participants in a (distributed) system. The architecture of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer because every participant in the network speaks the Bitcoin protocol at the same level . There are no \"special\" Bitcoin nodes. It means that every peer treats every transaction the same; it has no context in the peer's system apart from that which it gets from the network.\" Context and state are critical in distributed systems, because they are shared between all the peers who can therefore change that state according to certain rules, if they speak the agreed-upon language. This is very different to a client-server architecture like Facebook, who retain total control over the state, as well as your data. \"Money is something that we don't talk about or teach, and perhaps this is a result of the architecture. Precious metals stored in a vault against which paper is issued mean that money in this expression is a form of debt, which curtails our discussions. How many of you have money in a bank? [everyone raises their hands] None of you have money in a bank! You have loaned your money to a bank: it is not the same thing.\" The bank-customer relationship is an earlier form of the same client-server architecture, and the money involved here only exists on a ledger that you do not have access to, or the ability to influence. \"Another term used for this client-server architecture where you maintain only a weak copy is a master-slave architecture. If you think about previous technologies of money as using this master-slave architecture, you have to ask an uncomfortable question: who is the slave?\" \"Bitcoin is totally different, because you don't owe anyone anything, nor does anyone owe you anything. It is not a system based on debt. It is a system based on absolute ownership of an abstract token. In Bitcoin, possession is 10/10ths of the law. Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation because it changes radically the architecture of money into one where every participant is equal and where a transaction has no state or context other than that required to obey the rules of a network no-one controls. Your money is yours; no-one can censor it, sieze it, or freeze. No-one can tell you what to say with your money.\" The point about architecture is critical to understanding the deeper intentions of this KERNEL course: we want to teach you how to see the underlying patterns in things so that you can more efficiently process all the information coming at you and pick the most relevant bits, based on a firm grasp of the fundamentals, which will help you transform your knowledge and skills to those required to overhaul the web now that we have protocols for money. \"Rather than focussing on intrinsic value, we should be thinking about intrinsic utility . Bitcoin represents a moment of immense intrinsic utility: it is software-as-money, money-as-a-content-type, money-as-a-service. Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: it turns it into the internet of money . Later in the Q A session Andreas makes the point that \"Bitcoin is a choice; it's opt-in.\" So, the internet of money is not a given: it's what we're building now. It is our responsibility to make it transparent and eminently usable, while keeping it peer-to-peer, borderless, open, and fair. \"Interestingly enough, I think the blockchain will create a completely new kind of common good that we've never seen before. If you accept the idea that Bitcoin, or something like it, will continue to exist, we arrive at a place where - for the first time in history - we have a shared historical record which does not decay in time and cannot be changed: immutable history forever [...] This immutable history will itself become a common good with a scale in time that we have never had before, in any civilization (even those that carved their ledgers in stone). What is your time horizon? Your life? Your children's life? Or something deeper and more durable than all these transient generations?","title":"Money Talks"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#money-talks","text":"This slightly older Andreas Antonopoulos talk is part of a playlist which is enormously valuable for setting the scene in our current study.

Very quickly, they invent both armed robbery and prostitution. What does this tell you about the nature of money? The important insight is that money is a form of communication . At it's very basic level, money isn't value: money represents an abstraction of value. It's a way of communicating value . Money is a language .\" If money is a language, what does an innovation which makes its medium logically decentralized really mean? It may mean that no-one will control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no-one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use. What will you choose to say in this ancient language we are revitalizing? \"Communicating value to each other is the basis of creating social bonds. Money is an important social tool .\" Money as linguistic technology is (and always has been) about the scale at which you can play your co-ordination game. The scale is now planetary. Are you ready to make your move? \"Think about how often the technology of money has been transformed. Very basically, communicating value can take place through an exchange of things of equal value. The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. And then nothing for a few thousand years. Then came the idea that I can deposit my gold with someone trustworthy; they can issue a paper certificate for my deposit; and I can trade that paper. With every technological revolution in money, there comes skepticism; and this is the moment of greatest skepticism in our history. The move to paper was highly controversial. It took about 400 years for paper as money to become broadly accepted. Then, 60 years ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards were paper, but then Diner's Club in the US created the first recognizable credit card (which was originally a form of a traveler's cheque). Now we have Bitcoin which represents a new form of 'doing money' and is as radical as the change from precious metals to paper, perhaps even more so. This is because our history as a species has to do with tangible expressions of wealth, and now we're dealing with a network-centric form of money which is totally abstract.\" We're really looking at a phase change in the expressive power of money: i.e. it can now be programmed to do stuff dynamically in addition to being traded. Think about this for a while and reconsider what it really means to write a smart contract in light of all this history. \"Bitcoin isn't just digital money (we already have that). Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation in the technology of money . So, let's talk about network architecture, because Bitcoin isn't happening in a vacuum; it's happening at a moment in history when we are seeing a transformation in many social institutions; i.e. the network-centric era. The internet has precipitated the change of many closed, hierarchical organizations and institutions into platforms . We've started seeing the introduction of interfaces - APIs - where information can flow in and out of the organization. Now, even more transformation is occurring with the change from platforms to protocols ; the difference being that, in protocols, there is no central appeal. TCP/IP doesn't work with reference to a service provider; TCP/IP works, without context , everywhere in the world. You don't have to sign up for an account, you just have to use the language . Once you go from a platform to a language, it creates a host of new possibilities. Bitcoin is the first, network-centric, protocol for money and what that means is that it exists without reference to an institution or platform. Once you've understood that money is a language used since time immemorial to communicate value, and that 2009 saw a phase shift from controlled, closed platforms to open, permissionless protocols; you've got the whole thing. What matters now is the precedents we set as the first users of these new protocols. \"'Peer-to-peer' money refers to an architecture which describes the relationship between participants in a (distributed) system. The architecture of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer because every participant in the network speaks the Bitcoin protocol at the same level . There are no \"special\" Bitcoin nodes. It means that every peer treats every transaction the same; it has no context in the peer's system apart from that which it gets from the network.\" Context and state are critical in distributed systems, because they are shared between all the peers who can therefore change that state according to certain rules, if they speak the agreed-upon language. This is very different to a client-server architecture like Facebook, who retain total control over the state, as well as your data. \"Money is something that we don't talk about or teach, and perhaps this is a result of the architecture. Precious metals stored in a vault against which paper is issued mean that money in this expression is a form of debt, which curtails our discussions. How many of you have money in a bank? [everyone raises their hands] None of you have money in a bank! You have loaned your money to a bank: it is not the same thing.\" The bank-customer relationship is an earlier form of the same client-server architecture, and the money involved here only exists on a ledger that you do not have access to, or the ability to influence. \"Another term used for this client-server architecture where you maintain only a weak copy is a master-slave architecture. If you think about previous technologies of money as using this master-slave architecture, you have to ask an uncomfortable question: who is the slave?\" \"Bitcoin is totally different, because you don't owe anyone anything, nor does anyone owe you anything. It is not a system based on debt. It is a system based on absolute ownership of an abstract token. In Bitcoin, possession is 10/10ths of the law. Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation because it changes radically the architecture of money into one where every participant is equal and where a transaction has no state or context other than that required to obey the rules of a network no-one controls. Your money is yours; no-one can censor it, sieze it, or freeze. No-one can tell you what to say with your money.\" The point about architecture is critical to understanding the deeper intentions of this KERNEL course: we want to teach you how to see the underlying patterns in things so that you can more efficiently process all the information coming at you and pick the most relevant bits, based on a firm grasp of the fundamentals, which will help you transform your knowledge and skills to those required to overhaul the web now that we have protocols for money. \"Rather than focussing on intrinsic value, we should be thinking about intrinsic utility . Bitcoin represents a moment of immense intrinsic utility: it is software-as-money, money-as-a-content-type, money-as-a-service. Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: it turns it into the internet of money . Later in the Q A session Andreas makes the point that \"Bitcoin is a choice; it's opt-in.\" So, the internet of money is not a given: it's what we're building now. It is our responsibility to make it transparent and eminently usable, while keeping it peer-to-peer, borderless, open, and fair. \"Interestingly enough, I think the blockchain will create a completely new kind of common good that we've never seen before. If you accept the idea that Bitcoin, or something like it, will continue to exist, we arrive at a place where - for the first time in history - we have a shared historical record which does not decay in time and cannot be changed: immutable history forever [...] This immutable history will itself become a common good with a scale in time that we have never had before, in any civilization (even those that carved their ledgers in stone). What is your time horizon? Your life? Your children's life? Or something deeper and more durable than all these transient generations?","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-0/play-of-pattern/","text":"\ud83c\udf08 The play of pattern None of the KERNEL Core Learning Objectives have concrete answers.

Liars and cheats Bitcoin began with maxim \"Don't trust, verify\" . That is, trust can only begin where verification ends. Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie. Because we can codify the ways in which it is possible to cheat, we can also write executable software rules, with deterministic results, that prevent cheating in the protocols we use to define and transfer value. This demonstrates how to use complementary opposites as a mode of thought to identify patterns of meaning. We can build protocols with strong trust guarantees by defining clearly, and encoding , what it means to lie. To understand trust, you must know the details of all possible deceptions. Such rules do not mean we need no longer trust at all. It means that there is an implicit shift from trusting those who own the media by which we transfer value, to those with whom we are actually transacting. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on this statement Vires in numeris The above is another early Bitcoin maxim which means \"Truth in numbers\". It goes back to Pythagoras, for whom \"All things are number\". The implicit shift towards trusting those we're actually transacting with is enabled due to a fundamental change in the language by which value is defined. Instead of regulatory fiat, enforced by legal prose and human courts backed by the threat of violence; Bitcoin enables a network of peers to create the conditions required for a functional currency through mathematics alone, enforced by deterministic computation. The saying also implies that \ud83d\udca1 Trust has something to do with truth. The more succinctly we can express shared truths, the easier it becomes to verify (and therefore trust) the systems we use. Publicly verifiable truth means more humans can reach consensus on the basic state of their shared realities and get on transacting in increasingly valuable ways based on new kinds of trust. It's a profound feedback loop : use a universal language (math) to define succinctly what it means to cheat, enforce penalties in a deterministic and executable way based on your definitions (code), which allows more humans to experiment with interpersonal trust in ways previously unimaginable. To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary. Access-ability Ultimately, we're not interested in trust based on blind faith. We're interested in deterministic verifi ability between peers. The Bitcoin source code can be audited by anyone, anywhere in the world - so it's not just ability we're interested in here, but also access . Trust, in a practical day-to-day sense, has a lot to do with transparency and education. This requires a certain kind of architectual innovation in the very structure of money: no more clients and servers; everyone needs to be a peer. Please take a look over the brief of the next piece of curated material - Money Talks - to get a sense for what a peer-to-peer architecture of money, and waht money as a protocol is really all about. Deeper down the rabbit hole Of course, all this raises the question, \"What is truth?\" Note that we're interested in shared truth above, i.e. consensus. Absolute Truth is beyond the scope of this course, though you can use the same framework to think about it. One does not approach an absolute by trying to define it, but through being clear about what it is not . If you are honest and clear enough, then whatever is left over after all your negation must necessarily be the truth.

For that, we must turn away from the men and invite the sparkling character of May Li Khoe onto the stage. How does this fit into KERNEL? This wonderful presentation has been selected to deepen your appreciation of where meaning might stem from, how we can literally design our own perceptions and experiences of the world to generate more of it and thereby create value both for ourselves and the communities of which we are a part. Brief May Li begins by speaking about her mixed ancestry and the effect this has had on her approach to, and understanding of, value and meaning. As one of the designers who worked on the first iPhone, she has a unique perspective on the ability we have to design both. She also speaks about the US-sanctioned massacres in Indonesia in 1965 - one of the places she originates from - and how these, too, have effected the way she sees the structure of society and what she calls \"dominant narratives.\" \"Instead of thinking of life as a series of checks which I need to tick off - something which can be displayed on a graph that climbs ever up and to the right - I like to think of my life as a canvas which I can paint with whatever weird artwork I feel like [...] Here is my mandatory Venn diagram: the status quo needs to change, and life is short. When we put these two together, we can see that we need to subvert the status quo and have as much fun as possible along the way!\" It's colourful and light and funny, but also a deeply profound point. To illustrate further: the point of meditation is not to get \"good\" at sitting around, thinking about nothing: it is to turn your life into a meditative one. Every act itself a meditation. May Li talks about it in terms of turning the living of life into an artwork. The question is, what is the primary means we have a making art of our lives? This course will contend that it is designing dialogue . Therefore, we turn back and listen further: \"The first example is BBQ Becky, a woman who called the police on black people having a barbecue [...

And now it's a tradition! [...] The second example is called 'futbolistas 4 life' [...] Something that was important for a lot of the students was feeling like they had this space to play; and freedom and ownership over their play and their bodies in a place that felt good [...] 'Having a space like a soccer field where we can play and love one another: that's an act of resistance '.\" In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a society based on fear; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance. Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot.

It's heart to heart, here in the prison yards where we're using matching funds to build playgrounds where we can love again. Small things \"When you do these little, joyful subversions remember that they can be really small. They don't have to be these grandiose events with hundreds or thousands of people.

The word \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1 in Homeric Greek means \"pure, fresh air\" or \"clear sky\". It is also often translated as \"quintessence\": the material that fills the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere. The aether is the air of another realm, which nevertheless interacts with our own by virtue of the meaning we enact in our use of the four terrestrial elements. The octahedron is the middle solid, and therefore associated in more modern metaphysics with the heart; love; compassion; forgiveness; and healing.

Written by Nick Szabo in 2002, it provides a unique window into understanding why blockchains matter beyond the purely monetary applications. How does this fit into KERNEL? That said, we have chosen this essay specifically because it shows how money and trade led to the development of written language - an idea we began exploring with Andreas Antonopoulos in the previous module. Moreover, it speaks directly to Why we should (continue to) build censorship resistant tools How we have always, and can continue to, secure our most valuable communications. Brief \"Let\u2018s distinguish between seals, the often cleverly carved cylinders or stamps that make the impressions, and sealings, the resulting impressions rolled or stamped on wet clay, and the clay they were impressed upon. Sealings of clay were wrapped around rope knots to seal bales of goods, and around the rims of wicker baskets and pottery jars to seal in their contents [...] Seals were carved from hard materials \u2013 usually stone but sometimes faience, glass, metal, wood, or bone. Sometimes sun-dried or baked clay itself was used. The Greeks and Romans used signet rings, their action ends shaped from metal or carved from gems, to stamp wax.\" This may seem a bit random, but data integrity is critical to trade and trust relationships. Without some way to guarantee the quality and provenance of goods, no real trade can occur. \"The earliest stamp seals found were used in Iran in 5,000 B.C. Later on archaeologists can use both the trade in seals themselves, as well as the distances between seals and the corresponding sealings, to trace long-distance trade networks.\" The means of securing our trade, and therefore trust, relationships are also the means by which we can understand the network within which they operate. This is still true today, and provides some neat context for why a shared, global, ownerless, borderless means of recording history is so vital and interesting a development. \"For the Sumerians a business protocol was also a religious ritual, and the reverse was usually true as well. In the Middle East seal breaking became one of the most important of these rituals, with terrifying spiritual consequences if the seal were broken by the wrong person or at the wrong time.\" This may also lack a bit of context right now, but will become important in the final week when we get to Sacred Economics. Until then, read on, because here is the meat of this article - how trade and money lead directly to the development of writing: \"The first documents ever written, in the 4 th millennium B.C., were about wheat and barley, and were sealed. Far earlier still, at least as far back as 8,000 B.C., archeologists have found even more salient artifacts \u2013 vast numbers of little clay tokens [...] Now we know that these tokens led directly to what are now the very basics of our civilization \u2013 reading, writing, and arithmetic. \"Soon after 4,000 B.C., the clay tokens were combined with the idea of sealing to create bills of lading and warehouse receipts. To create a bill of lading for a consignment of sheep, the owner put in a one-sheep token for every sheep. Every time he counted five sheep, a five-sheep token could be substituted for a one-sheep token. Once the owner and the consignee agreed on the count, the tokens were placed in a wet clay envelope. The owner and the consignee rolled their seals over the envelope, then let it dry. [...] The receipt was tokens sealed in an envelope \u2013 when the owner got hungry, or wanted to sell to the hungry, or wanted the seed to plant next spring \u2013 he would take the envelope to the warehouse. The claimant and the warehouse operator would inspect the seal, break it, inspect the tokens, and then deliver the goods. \"It would be nice if one could learn the contents of the envelope \u2013 the number and kind of tokens \u2013 without having to take the ominous and irreversible step of breaking the seal. Around 3,400 B.C. in Sumer, marks started appearing on the outside of these envelopes. These marks were simply made by the tokens themselves. The different shapes and sizes of the tokens created correspondingly unique impressions, and thus the same symbols [...] \"With different tokens for one sheep, five sheep, one pot of barley, five pots of barley, and so forth, we get m * n different tokens [...] By creating separate tokens for the numbers and the goods, the number of different kinds of tokens were reduced to m + n , at the cost of up to twice as many tokens per envelope. \"This development wasn\u2018t entirely new. Abstract counting tokens, reused for sheep and people and pots of barley, are probably far more ancient. Nor were separate words for \u201csheep\u201d, and \u201cbarley\u201d new. What was new were the separate tokens for \u201csheep\u201d, \u201cbarley\u201d, to be used, like the counting tokens, in the bills of lading and warehouse receipts. They were still thought of as corresponding to the objects they represented, not the words \u201csheep\u201d and \u201cbarley\u201d, but it was a big step towards written language. \"The evolution of writing proceeded from there. A hundred years later reed styluses were being used to mimic the clay token marks. Over the centuries, scribes supplemented or replaced token-derived symbols with pictographs for the objects. The pictographs attempted to depict the object visually. Both kinds of symbols became stylized as wedges, or \u201ccuneiform\u201d, optimized for the reed stylus. Still later, words represented by neither pictographs nor token-derived symbols come to be represented by a rebus.\" And that's all she wrote! Well, not quite, but it is one of the more believable stories about the development of the written word and takes us into the very heart of what it is we're really innovating on in KERNEL. Seals, while historically fascinating, were not the only method of providing evidence of foul play: \"Along with the tamper evident clay, the Sumerians developed a kind of virtual tamper evidence. It took the form of two sets of numbers. On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately \u2013 for example on the front would be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded \u201c265\u201d \u2013 the same objects counted again, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them [...] Checksums still form the basis of modern accounting. Indeed, the principle of double entry bookkeeping is based on two sets of independently derived numbers that must add up to the same number.\" From here, Szabo describes modern means of providing tamper evidence and describes the use of cryptography - that is, secret writing - to provide both unspoofable checksums with one-way hash functions, as well as the development of digital signatures. So, what does this all have to do with Ethereum's state and history?

Sealings of clay were wrapped around rope knots to seal bales of goods, and around the rims of wicker baskets and pottery jars to seal in their contents [...] Seals were carved from hard materials \u2013 usually stone but sometimes faience, glass, metal, wood, or bone. Sometimes sun-dried or baked clay itself was used. The Greeks and Romans used signet rings, their action ends shaped from metal or carved from gems, to stamp wax.\" This may seem a bit random, but data integrity is critical to trade and trust relationships. Without some way to guarantee the quality and provenance of goods, no real trade can occur. \"The earliest stamp seals found were used in Iran in 5,000 B.C. Later on archaeologists can use both the trade in seals themselves, as well as the distances between seals and the corresponding sealings, to trace long-distance trade networks.\" The means of securing our trade, and therefore trust, relationships are also the means by which we can understand the network within which they operate. This is still true today, and provides some neat context for why a shared, global, ownerless, borderless means of recording history is so vital and interesting a development. \"For the Sumerians a business protocol was also a religious ritual, and the reverse was usually true as well. In the Middle East seal breaking became one of the most important of these rituals, with terrifying spiritual consequences if the seal were broken by the wrong person or at the wrong time.\" This may also lack a bit of context right now, but will become important in the final week when we get to Sacred Economics. Until then, read on, because here is the meat of this article - how trade and money lead directly to the development of writing: \"The first documents ever written, in the 4 th millennium B.C., were about wheat and barley, and were sealed. Far earlier still, at least as far back as 8,000 B.C., archeologists have found even more salient artifacts \u2013 vast numbers of little clay tokens [...] Now we know that these tokens led directly to what are now the very basics of our civilization \u2013 reading, writing, and arithmetic. \"Soon after 4,000 B.C., the clay tokens were combined with the idea of sealing to create bills of lading and warehouse receipts. To create a bill of lading for a consignment of sheep, the owner put in a one-sheep token for every sheep. Every time he counted five sheep, a five-sheep token could be substituted for a one-sheep token. Once the owner and the consignee agreed on the count, the tokens were placed in a wet clay envelope. The owner and the consignee rolled their seals over the envelope, then let it dry. [...] The receipt was tokens sealed in an envelope \u2013 when the owner got hungry, or wanted to sell to the hungry, or wanted the seed to plant next spring \u2013 he would take the envelope to the warehouse. The claimant and the warehouse operator would inspect the seal, break it, inspect the tokens, and then deliver the goods. \"It would be nice if one could learn the contents of the envelope \u2013 the number and kind of tokens \u2013 without having to take the ominous and irreversible step of breaking the seal. Around 3,400 B.C. in Sumer, marks started appearing on the outside of these envelopes. These marks were simply made by the tokens themselves. The different shapes and sizes of the tokens created correspondingly unique impressions, and thus the same symbols [...] \"With different tokens for one sheep, five sheep, one pot of barley, five pots of barley, and so forth, we get m * n different tokens [...] By creating separate tokens for the numbers and the goods, the number of different kinds of tokens were reduced to m + n , at the cost of up to twice as many tokens per envelope. \"This development wasn\u2018t entirely new. Abstract counting tokens, reused for sheep and people and pots of barley, are probably far more ancient. Nor were separate words for \u201csheep\u201d, and \u201cbarley\u201d new. What was new were the separate tokens for \u201csheep\u201d, \u201cbarley\u201d, to be used, like the counting tokens, in the bills of lading and warehouse receipts. They were still thought of as corresponding to the objects they represented, not the words \u201csheep\u201d and \u201cbarley\u201d, but it was a big step towards written language. \"The evolution of writing proceeded from there. A hundred years later reed styluses were being used to mimic the clay token marks. Over the centuries, scribes supplemented or replaced token-derived symbols with pictographs for the objects. The pictographs attempted to depict the object visually. Both kinds of symbols became stylized as wedges, or \u201ccuneiform\u201d, optimized for the reed stylus. Still later, words represented by neither pictographs nor token-derived symbols come to be represented by a rebus.\" And that's all she wrote! Well, not quite, but it is one of the more believable stories about the development of the written word and takes us into the very heart of what it is we're really innovating on in KERNEL. Seals, while historically fascinating, were not the only method of providing evidence of foul play: \"Along with the tamper evident clay, the Sumerians developed a kind of virtual tamper evidence. It took the form of two sets of numbers. On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately \u2013 for example on the front would be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded \u201c265\u201d \u2013 the same objects counted again, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them [...] Checksums still form the basis of modern accounting. Indeed, the principle of double entry bookkeeping is based on two sets of independently derived numbers that must add up to the same number.\" From here, Szabo describes modern means of providing tamper evidence and describes the use of cryptography - that is, secret writing - to provide both unspoofable checksums with one-way hash functions, as well as the development of digital signatures. So, what does this all have to do with Ethereum's state and history? Well, apart from providing the history of our civilizational evolution towards global platforms capable of ensuring data integrity at scales never before possible, which thereby allow for trade in ways and at scales not before possible, it also sets the scene nicely for some of the modules to come. Bitcoin and Ethereum are not some aberration of the digital, technological age: they are the next block in a timeless story about the evolution of trust and its concomitant effect on what it means to be human.

It's especially useful to look back and ask what of the original ideas we have succeeded in implementing, and where there are still opportunities for improvement. This video has been selected to assist you deepen your (more technical) understanding of: Value Trust Incentives Censorship resistance (Not just!) money and speech Brief This video is the genesis of the calculator (Bitcoin) vs smartphone (Ethereum) analogy and a demonstration of the power of generality... \"Instead of having a protocol that is designed around one very small set of use cases, you just create a general-purpose operating system and you let people build whatever they want as applications on top of it.\" Ethereum is a blockchain, with a few additions: Built-in Turing-complete scripting language - essentially hybrid between standard VM architectures, Bitcoin script and a \"few other things\". People can write programs in this script, or high level languages that compile down to this script, take these compiled scripts, put them into transactions and send them to the blockchain. The transaction gets confirmed and you get a special account at that address. Contractual accounts and Externally Owned Accounts have the same privileges . Anyone can create an application, with any rules. Anyone can then interact with that application, i.e. you can do NameCoin in 10 lines of code... State is defined as a key value mapping addresses to account objects. Every account object has a nonce and balance. Contract accounts also include a code hash and storage trie root. Vitalik then discusses how transactions work - important low-level details for us to build a full conceptual picture in the weeks ahead. \"You can actually think of it as being a fairly simple system. You can think of the state as being a database, and you can think of each of these contracts as being programs that are sitting on one computer, except the computer is massively globally distributed. It's actually a highly secure network backed by tens of thousands computers around the world. It's bold because it's important.\" However, this raises the spectre of \"The Halting Problem\", which Vitalik explains as being solved by gas: a fee for every computational step the computer must take, where there is a limit to computational steps possible per block. This means there is no technical limit on what can be put in the data field of a transaction, but there is an economic one, as the more data you include, the more expensive it becomes. It was an extra 68gas for every byte of data you include at that time, though it may have changed now. \ud83d\udca1 Exercise for the reader: how would you tell what the gas price per byte currently is? Vitalik then discusses some of the intricacies v , r , and s from elliptic curve cryptography, and how v is an extra field used for public key recovery. He also provides further information on receipts and logs and why logs are cheaper and allow for efficient light-client access. Although it may sound boring, this is the heart of how we build censorship resistance tools. This is followed by a description of the Ethereum Virtual Machine : Stack - up to 1024 32-byte fields. Memory - just an infinitely expanding byte array, but the more you expand the byte array, the more gas you have to pay. Most of the limits aren't static, they're economic and you'll see this idea again and again. Storage - permanent for contracts. You can read and write to it. Environment variables - VM can access block number, time, mining difficulty, previous block hash etc. Logs - append-only storage in a specific block, not in state. Sub-calling - opcode by which VM can itself call other contracts. Then Vitalik discusses ABI and RLP (recursive length prefix) encoding. \"For people who are set theory geeks\". Again, this may seem boring, but it is a demonstration of the early culture and how the people who built all this stuff really think. This is followed by an explanation of memory-hard algorithms for mining and why they were an innovation. Again, worth listening to for cultural context, but 23:50 - 28:57 is now a bit outdated. Vitalik also emphasises the fast block time (17s) and discusses uncles - which solve \"stale rates\" of blocks which arise due to network latency. He makes the critical point that merkle tries are \"a construction that allows for compact, efficiently-verifiable proofs that a particular transaction was included in a particular block.\" It's not just transactions in the Merkle trie though; it's the state too: i.e. that storage trie root we talked about in the account object earlier. Here is why understanding the low-level details allows us to build a comprehensive conceptual picture of how it all ties together. So, you're less technical then Vitalik (i.e. all of us) and are wondering what this all really means? Well, the critical point is this notion of a general purpose operating system - one, monolithic virtual machine distributed across the world which is shared by everyone, owned by no-one and which can't be turned off without also turning off the internet. Even with Bitcoin, we got this feature that you could carry 12 magical words in your head across any border in the world, incant them into an internet-connected machine and have immediate access to value. Now, there is the possibility that you could pull down not just monetary value, but generalised compute .

This is, in a sense, the ultimate question. So, how can we use our new thinking skills based on complementary opposites to break it down and come to some useful insights? \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to pause here and consider it for yourself before reading further... We can begin by asking, \"What destroys value?\" Some suggestions include: inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception, dispersion, hatred. Hopefully you can begin to see why playing with pattern is such a valuable and powerful means of thinking. Instead of egotistically presupposing we can drive straight into a coherent answer, the idea is to explore the space of seeming opposition as this, more often than not, sheds light in surprising ways on the original question. In the same way that building trustless protocols means defining clearly what it means to cheat; we can come to understand far more about value by considering first what it is not. If it is not inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception and hatred, then it seems like trust in clearly shared truths lies at the core of how we might generate valuable interactions between people. Consensus So, how do we create shared truth? The simple answer is: through fiction . People tend to look down on fiction, even though it is really just the lie which reveals truth. What matters most in terms of true value generation is the efficiency of the language you employ to tell your fiction. The legal fiction of the firm resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in our ability to generate value based on new kinds of transactions. It has also ended up being extractive and corrupt, because legal text must be parsed and interpreted by humans, who are error-prone and easy to manipulate; and because legal text is - in fact - enforced by the threat of violence which relies on the asymmetric power of a nation state. Blockchains implement a new kind of mathematical consensus fiction. The core question remains: how many people can reliably share in the truth your fiction reveals, for this defines the constraints of what kinds of value can be generated with it. Narrative Tribal narratives allowed truth to be shared between ~150 people. These evolved into religious myths around the time of the agricultural revolution. It's no coincidence that, concomitant with the spread of the first major religious myths, came the development of writing; the primary use of which was tracking debt. Myth alone is not enough to hold societies larger than your average tribe together: it needs to be paired with a shared record, built around succinct and significant symbols. Without tracing the whole history, one can see how our ability to create value has always been tied to the ways in which we tell stories about, and with, our shared records . However, prior to the feedback loop outlined in trust , the record was maintained by someone , which gives them enormous power and means everyone else is incentivized to try and manipulate them. Because blockchains allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, and because the record itself is shared across all participants, there is a whole new \"trust space\" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions.","title":"Value"},{"location":"module-1/value/#value","text":"What is value? This is, in a sense, the ultimate question. So, how can we use our new thinking skills based on complementary opposites to break it down and come to some useful insights? \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to pause here and consider it for yourself before reading further... We can begin by asking, \"What destroys value?\" Some suggestions include: inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception, dispersion, hatred. Hopefully you can begin to see why playing with pattern is such a valuable and powerful means of thinking. Instead of egotistically presupposing we can drive straight into a coherent answer, the idea is to explore the space of seeming opposition as this, more often than not, sheds light in surprising ways on the original question. In the same way that building trustless protocols means defining clearly what it means to cheat; we can come to understand far more about value by considering first what it is not. If it is not inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception and hatred, then it seems like trust in clearly shared truths lies at the core of how we might generate valuable interactions between people.","title":"\ud83d\udcaf Value"},{"location":"module-1/value/#consensus","text":"So, how do we create shared truth? The simple answer is: through fiction . People tend to look down on fiction, even though it is really just the lie which reveals truth. What matters most in terms of true value generation is the efficiency of the language you employ to tell your fiction. The legal fiction of the firm resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in our ability to generate value based on new kinds of transactions.

Rimble An open-source library of React components and guides to help you make dApps everyone can use. Create Whimsical A visual workspace. You can build more beautiful flow charts more easily in here than in Diagrams.net, though perhaps not quite as extensive or complicated. H/T Nazzareno Massari Visualise sketch.systems A tool for prototyping state machines. Useful for whiteboarding sessions and iterating quickly with designs which you can play with in real time. H/T Mike Ryan Sketch Machinations A tool intended for game designers which can be put to great use for mechanism design and token economics. H/T James Young Mechanise DAI-UI Though in early stages, there are some useful recipes here. It also uses theme-ui, so check out that library for all your normal design needs, especially if you're building in React.
