Each module is made up of two sections: Crafted Reading , which we will expect you to have read before the beginning of each new week; and Curated Material which is made up of articles, videos, and the occasional podcast that we highly recommend you go over before the Fireside Chat each week. Structure Crafted Reading is made up of 2 separate lessons: a \"personal\" lesson designed to teach you one of the principles we believe are important for your own navigation of this new and wild web; and a \"web 3\" lesson which is more technical and goes to the heart of critical concepts which we often don't reflect upon enough, like \"Trust\", \"Value\" and \"Freedom\". The Crafted Reading is specifically not long and hopefully not boring. It should take you a maximum of 5 minutes to read each piece, so we only expect 10 minutes of reading before the beginning of each week. The ideas each piece presents are not \"the truth\" - they are intended to get you thinking so that you can come to your own unique conclusions about a wide range of critical topics. Curated Material is specifically not a long list of links no-one will ever have the time truly to reflect upon. We have picked at most 3 pieces for each week, in different formats (video, text, audio), and we have written very detailed briefs for each piece. This is because we don't want to flood you with information; we want to teach you how to find the best information and then genuinely use it to transform your own skills, understanding and general approach to thinking about and building decentralized systems and tools. We highly recommend that you at least familiarise yourself with each brief. Timing and talking Weeks begin on Tuesdays , because part of what we're doing here is breaking down our conditioned, culturally-acquired ways of thinking. What is more conditioning than the days of the week? Free yourself from Julian hegemony! \ud83d\ude09 Our Fireside Chat, which is when we'll bring in esteemed speakers from across the industry and introduce you to the most experienced and brilliant minds we know, will generally occur each Thursday. Fireside chats revolve specifically around the theme for that week. They will be fairly structured, and broadcast live on YouTube for you to watch, with a live chat to ask questions if there is time. As you'll see in this module, though, conversations are critical to KERNEL and the framework for learning which we're presenting here. So, throughout the course of each week, we will also have a number of Juntos - smaller, break-off conversations on a variety of themes, each hosted by a an expert in that particular field. You must sign-up for these Juntos - we can accommodate at most 12 people, otherwise the conversations lose the intimacy and coherence which is their main purpose. If you don't sign up in time for a Junto you'd really like to attend, don't stress! They will also be broadcast live on YouTube, so you'll get to see the conversation happening in real-time, you just won't be able to participate actively in each one. The speakers and mentors who host these Juntos will also be around in our chat channels, so you can direct your questions to them outside the allocated time for that specific gathering.","title":"Intro to KERNEL"},{"location":"module-0/#module-0-an-introduction-to-kernel","text":"KERNEL is an 8 week program, and we'll be covering a new learning module each week.

How does this fit into KERNEL? There are many important takeaways here for the conversations we will be having in KERNEL Juntos, and beyond. \"The quality of listening determines the quality of speaking.\" \"When people are listening, I'm compelled to speak more truth.\" We should aspire to positive sum, horizontal conversations (9:14 in the video). Horizontal conversations: interactive dialogue among peers. Participants share trust, living within the same context. Conversations continue and can be picked up tomorrow, or next week, or sometime later. Much more meaning is shared. \"I have a lot of respect for people who think as they speak, and who pause to think and to attach the meaning that matters .\" Vertical conversations: Each person speaks to get their point in \u2014 not building upon each other. It becomes a competition because you are thinking of what to say instead of listening. It doesn't allow one to hear, or to speak truthfully. Less meaning is shared. Asking better questions by listening more deeply What kinds of speech really carry value ? Brief \"We live in a world where it's become the fashion to just drop these cute one-liners at each other and think then that we know things. We ask questions without really wanting the answer - all we're seeking is a quick-fix; a conceptual solution to a curiosity that doesn't really matter because it's just a passing fancy. We don't live in a world where we have conversations about things that really matter! I mean endless explorations of the truth outside of ourselves...\" What is the truth outside yourself? How could you build open tools that encourage people to explore such ideas and connect in truly meaningful ways? \"We have a thousand alternatives for every fundamental, and we spend much of our lives preoccupied with those alternatives. Our lives therefore tend to be far more incidentally bound, rather than fundamentally related . In this we express our separation: from the natural world, from the fundamentals, from the cosmos.\" This is a profound linguistic play: we all find ourselves caught up in seemingly insignificant tasks which consistenly get in the way of that really profound thing you've been meaning to learn or do. Why is this? How can we move more of our daily existence into that which is not bound and imprisoned in trivialities, but rather fundamentally related to everything around us? Isn't that what a web does? \"I missed True Voice \". What is True Voice? Have you ever heard it? \"People listen. There are pauses between speaking which are filled with thinking, and with understanding.\" How comfortable are you with silence? Is this actually not the measure of companionship - how comfortable the silences are? \"Modern conversation doesn't give space for the words to settle in the listener [...] I have a lot of respect for people who think as they speak, and who pause to think and to attach the meaning that matters .\" How can you cultivate the space within yourself required to listen well? What does it really mean to attach conscious meaning to the words you say or write? How is this amplified when those words are executable code? \"One's speaking must be shaped by the quality of the listener. So, when you're listening to me I am compelled to speak more sense. I am compelled to speak more truth.

How could you get to their opposite to see how hollow fear and longing really are? \"Modern humanity does not learn by being gifted. Our path is different. We're constituted to ask questions. For us, knowing is something that is achieved through effort, out of free will. The task of the modern human being is to clearly and definitively seek and find knowledge.

How can we cultivate more of that in our lives, and how can we build products which help \"every human soul take [even a] single step\" closer to their own truths? \"More and more I see the value of human conversation: the value of what arises between us when we speak in truth with what we have and what we seek.

Andreas was one of the first, and remains perhaps the most famous, presenter of Bitcoin and the ideas which inform it. Many of his talks and presentations have already become cultural artifacts. How does this fit into KERNEL? This talk provides an historical context for money and outlines why Bitcoin is important within that context. It has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Money and speech , and how closely interwoven these two have always been. Value in the broadest and most historical sense, with many pertinent examples provided. Meaning : this is not about money for the internet: it's about the internet of money. Brief Briefs present the most relevant quotes from the linked resource, with small pieces of added commentary where appropriate. \"If you think of money as technology, how old is this technology? [...] It's always surprising that people will say, 'Oh, 400 years old', '1000 years old', 'a few thousand years old'. In fact, we don't know how old money is [...] We have yet to discover a civilization that didn't have money. So, we know it's at least as old as civilization. One thing that really surprises people is that money is older than writing . The way we know this is that the first examples of writing [cuneiform and hieroglyphics] we have are writing about money - they're ledgers. Is writing older than the wheel? I don't know, but we do know that wheels were used as money. Money is an ancient technology .\" It's no small thing to talk about \"building better money\" because what we're actually talking about is a human symbolic construction which extends back beyond recorded history. Every time there has been a significant innovation in how money is expressed and/or used, very interesting things have happened to both the ways in which, and the scale at which, humans organize. \"Primates can be taught to use money: i.e. there are studies which show that you can teach them that specific stones can be exchanged for bananas. Very quickly, they invent both armed robbery and prostitution. What does this tell you about the nature of money? The important insight is that money is a form of communication . At it's very basic level, money isn't value: money represents an abstraction of value. It's a way of communicating value . Money is a language .\" If money is a language, what does an innovation which makes its medium logically decentralized really mean? It may mean that no-one will control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no-one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use. What will you choose to say in this ancient language we are revitalizing? \"Communicating value to each other is the basis of creating social bonds. Money is an important social tool .\" Money as linguistic technology is (and always has been) about the scale at which you can play your co-ordination game. The scale is now planetary. Are you ready to make your move? For the skeptics \"Think about how often the technology of money has been transformed. Very basically, communicating value can take place through an exchange of things of equal value. The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. And then nothing for a few thousand years. Then came the idea that I can deposit my gold with someone trustworthy; they can issue a paper certificate for my deposit; and I can trade that paper. With every technological revolution in money, there comes skepticism; and this is the moment of greatest skepticism in our history. The move to paper was highly controversial. It took about 400 years for paper as money to become broadly accepted. Then, 60 years ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards were paper, but then Diner's Club in the US created the first recognizable credit card (which was originally a form of a traveler's cheque). Now we have Bitcoin which represents a new form of 'doing money' and is as radical as the change from precious metals to paper, perhaps even more so. This is because our history as a species has to do with tangible expressions of wealth, and now we're dealing with a network-centric form of money which is totally abstract.\" We're really looking at a phase change in the expressive power of money: i.e. it can now be programmed to do stuff dynamically in addition to being traded. Think about this for a while and reconsider what it really means to write a smart contract in light of all this history. Open protocols and a network of value \"Bitcoin isn't just digital money (we already have that). Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation in the technology of money . So, let's talk about network architecture, because Bitcoin isn't happening in a vacuum; it's happening at a moment in history when we are seeing a transformation in many social institutions; i.e. the network-centric era. The internet has precipitated the change of many closed, hierarchical organizations and institutions into platforms . We've started seeing the introduction of interfaces - APIs - where information can flow in and out of the organization. Now, even more transformation is occurring with the change from platforms to protocols ; the difference being that, in protocols, there is no central appeal. TCP/IP doesn't work with reference to a service provider; TCP/IP works, without context , everywhere in the world. You don't have to sign up for an account, you just have to use the language . Once you go from a platform to a language, it creates a host of new possibilities. Bitcoin is the first, network-centric, protocol for money and what that means is that it exists without reference to an institution or platform. Once you've understood that money is a language used since time immemorial to communicate value, and that 2009 saw a phase shift from controlled, closed platforms to open, permissionless protocols; you've got the whole thing. What matters now is the precedents we set as the first users of these new protocols. \"'Peer-to-peer' money refers to an architecture which describes the relationship between participants in a (distributed) system. The architecture of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer because every participant in the network speaks the Bitcoin protocol at the same level . There are no \"special\" Bitcoin nodes. It means that every peer treats every transaction the same; it has no context in the peer's system apart from that which it gets from the network.\" Context and state are critical in distributed systems, because they are shared between all the peers who can therefore change that state according to certain rules, if they speak the agreed-upon language. This is very different to a client-server architecture like Facebook, who retain total control over the state, as well as your data. Master-slave vs peer-to-peer \"Money is something that we don't talk about or teach, and perhaps this is a result of the architecture. Precious metals stored in a vault against which paper is issued mean that money in this expression is a form of debt, which curtails our discussions. How many of you have money in a bank? [everyone raises their hands] None of you have money in a bank! You have loaned your money to a bank: it is not the same thing.\" The bank-customer relationship is an earlier form of the same client-server architecture, and the money involved here only exists on a ledger that you do not have access to, or the ability to influence. \"Another term used for this client-server architecture where you maintain only a weak copy is a master-slave architecture. If you think about previous technologies of money as using this master-slave architecture, you have to ask an uncomfortable question: who is the slave?\" \"Bitcoin is totally different, because you don't owe anyone anything, nor does anyone owe you anything. It is not a system based on debt. It is a system based on absolute ownership of an abstract token. In Bitcoin, possession is 10/10ths of the law. Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation because it changes radically the architecture of money into one where every participant is equal and where a transaction has no state or context other than that required to obey the rules of a network no-one controls. Your money is yours; no-one can censor it, sieze it, or freeze. No-one can tell you what to say with your money.\" The point about architecture is critical to understanding the deeper intentions of this KERNEL course: we want to teach you how to see the underlying patterns in things so that you can more efficiently process all the information coming at you and pick the most relevant bits, based on a firm grasp of the fundamentals, which will help you transform your knowledge and skills to those required to overhaul the web now that we have protocols for money. \"Rather than focussing on intrinsic value, we should be thinking about intrinsic utility . Bitcoin represents a moment of immense intrinsic utility: it is software-as-money, money-as-a-content-type, money-as-a-service. Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: it turns it into the internet of money . Later in the Q A session Andreas makes the point that \"Bitcoin is a choice; it's opt-in.\" So, the internet of money is not a given: it's what we're building now. It is our responsibility to make it transparent and eminently usable, while keeping it peer-to-peer, borderless, open, and fair. \"Interestingly enough, I think the blockchain will create a completely new kind of common good that we've never seen before. If you accept the idea that Bitcoin, or something like it, will continue to exist, we arrive at a place where - for the first time in history - we have a shared historical record which does not decay in time and cannot be changed: immutable history forever [...] This immutable history will itself become a common good with a scale in time that we have never had before, in any civilization (even those that carved their ledgers in stone). What is your time horizon? Your life? Your children's life? Or something deeper and more durable than all these transient generations?","title":"Money Talks"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#money-talks","text":"This slightly older Andreas Antonopoulos talk is part of a playlist which is enormously valuable for setting the scene in our current study.

Every time there has been a significant innovation in how money is expressed and/or used, very interesting things have happened to both the ways in which, and the scale at which, humans organize. \"Primates can be taught to use money: i.e. there are studies which show that you can teach them that specific stones can be exchanged for bananas. Very quickly, they invent both armed robbery and prostitution. What does this tell you about the nature of money? The important insight is that money is a form of communication . At it's very basic level, money isn't value: money represents an abstraction of value. It's a way of communicating value . Money is a language .\" If money is a language, what does an innovation which makes its medium logically decentralized really mean? It may mean that no-one will control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no-one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use. What will you choose to say in this ancient language we are revitalizing? \"Communicating value to each other is the basis of creating social bonds. Money is an important social tool .\" Money as linguistic technology is (and always has been) about the scale at which you can play your co-ordination game. The scale is now planetary. Are you ready to make your move?","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#for-the-skeptics","text":"\"Think about how often the technology of money has been transformed. Very basically, communicating value can take place through an exchange of things of equal value. The first major technological evolution is to exchange something you can't eat: shells, beads, feathers, a string with knots etc., so that money takes a more abstract form. It moves away from the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, and becomes something which refers to value as an abstraction. Precious metals fairly quickly became the most popular way of doing this because they're scarce, transportable, divisible, and universally valued for aesthetic purposes. It took thousands of years for this invention to take root, and we see it occurring around the time of the agrarian revolution. And then nothing for a few thousand years. Then came the idea that I can deposit my gold with someone trustworthy; they can issue a paper certificate for my deposit; and I can trade that paper. With every technological revolution in money, there comes skepticism; and this is the moment of greatest skepticism in our history. The move to paper was highly controversial. It took about 400 years for paper as money to become broadly accepted. Then, 60 years ago, we saw a new form of money in the form of plastic cards. In fact, the first cards were paper, but then Diner's Club in the US created the first recognizable credit card (which was originally a form of a traveler's cheque). Now we have Bitcoin which represents a new form of 'doing money' and is as radical as the change from precious metals to paper, perhaps even more so. This is because our history as a species has to do with tangible expressions of wealth, and now we're dealing with a network-centric form of money which is totally abstract.\" We're really looking at a phase change in the expressive power of money: i.e. it can now be programmed to do stuff dynamically in addition to being traded. Think about this for a while and reconsider what it really means to write a smart contract in light of all this history.","title":"For the skeptics"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value","text":"\"Bitcoin isn't just digital money (we already have that). Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation in the technology of money . So, let's talk about network architecture, because Bitcoin isn't happening in a vacuum; it's happening at a moment in history when we are seeing a transformation in many social institutions; i.e. the network-centric era. The internet has precipitated the change of many closed, hierarchical organizations and institutions into platforms . We've started seeing the introduction of interfaces - APIs - where information can flow in and out of the organization. Now, even more transformation is occurring with the change from platforms to protocols ; the difference being that, in protocols, there is no central appeal. TCP/IP doesn't work with reference to a service provider; TCP/IP works, without context , everywhere in the world. You don't have to sign up for an account, you just have to use the language . Once you go from a platform to a language, it creates a host of new possibilities. Bitcoin is the first, network-centric, protocol for money and what that means is that it exists without reference to an institution or platform. Once you've understood that money is a language used since time immemorial to communicate value, and that 2009 saw a phase shift from controlled, closed platforms to open, permissionless protocols; you've got the whole thing. What matters now is the precedents we set as the first users of these new protocols. \"'Peer-to-peer' money refers to an architecture which describes the relationship between participants in a (distributed) system. The architecture of Bitcoin is peer-to-peer because every participant in the network speaks the Bitcoin protocol at the same level . There are no \"special\" Bitcoin nodes. It means that every peer treats every transaction the same; it has no context in the peer's system apart from that which it gets from the network.\" Context and state are critical in distributed systems, because they are shared between all the peers who can therefore change that state according to certain rules, if they speak the agreed-upon language. This is very different to a client-server architecture like Facebook, who retain total control over the state, as well as your data.","title":"Open protocols and a network of value"},{"location":"module-0/money-language/#master-slave-vs-peer-to-peer","text":"\"Money is something that we don't talk about or teach, and perhaps this is a result of the architecture. Precious metals stored in a vault against which paper is issued mean that money in this expression is a form of debt, which curtails our discussions. How many of you have money in a bank? [everyone raises their hands] None of you have money in a bank! You have loaned your money to a bank: it is not the same thing.\" The bank-customer relationship is an earlier form of the same client-server architecture, and the money involved here only exists on a ledger that you do not have access to, or the ability to influence. \"Another term used for this client-server architecture where you maintain only a weak copy is a master-slave architecture. If you think about previous technologies of money as using this master-slave architecture, you have to ask an uncomfortable question: who is the slave?\" \"Bitcoin is totally different, because you don't owe anyone anything, nor does anyone owe you anything. It is not a system based on debt. It is a system based on absolute ownership of an abstract token. In Bitcoin, possession is 10/10ths of the law. Bitcoin is a fundamental transformation because it changes radically the architecture of money into one where every participant is equal and where a transaction has no state or context other than that required to obey the rules of a network no-one controls. Your money is yours; no-one can censor it, sieze it, or freeze. No-one can tell you what to say with your money.\" The point about architecture is critical to understanding the deeper intentions of this KERNEL course: we want to teach you how to see the underlying patterns in things so that you can more efficiently process all the information coming at you and pick the most relevant bits, based on a firm grasp of the fundamentals, which will help you transform your knowledge and skills to those required to overhaul the web now that we have protocols for money. \"Rather than focussing on intrinsic value, we should be thinking about intrinsic utility . Bitcoin represents a moment of immense intrinsic utility: it is software-as-money, money-as-a-content-type, money-as-a-service. Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: it turns it into the internet of money . Later in the Q A session Andreas makes the point that \"Bitcoin is a choice; it's opt-in.\" So, the internet of money is not a given: it's what we're building now. It is our responsibility to make it transparent and eminently usable, while keeping it peer-to-peer, borderless, open, and fair. \"Interestingly enough, I think the blockchain will create a completely new kind of common good that we've never seen before. If you accept the idea that Bitcoin, or something like it, will continue to exist, we arrive at a place where - for the first time in history - we have a shared historical record which does not decay in time and cannot be changed: immutable history forever [...] This immutable history will itself become a common good with a scale in time that we have never had before, in any civilization (even those that carved their ledgers in stone). What is your time horizon? Your life? Your children's life? Or something deeper and more durable than all these transient generations?","title":"Master-slave vs peer-to-peer"},{"location":"module-0/play-of-pattern/","text":"\ud83c\udf08 The play of pattern None of the KERNEL Core Learning Objectives have concrete answers.

Liars and cheats Bitcoin began with maxim \"Don't trust, verify\" . That is, trust can only begin where verification ends. Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie. Because we can codify the ways in which it is possible to cheat, we can also write executable software rules, with deterministic results, that prevent cheating in the protocols we use to define and transfer value. This demonstrates how to use complementary opposites as a mode of thought to identify patterns of meaning. We can build protocols with strong trust guarantees by defining clearly, and encoding , what it means to lie. To understand trust, you must know the details of all possible deceptions. Such rules do not mean we need no longer trust at all. It means that there is an implicit shift from trusting those who own the media by which we transfer value, to those with whom we are actually transacting. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on this statement Vires in numeris The above is another early Bitcoin maxim which means \"Strength in numbers\". It goes back to Pythagoras, for whom \"All things are number\". The implicit shift towards trusting those we're actually transacting with is enabled due to a fundamental change in the language by which value is defined. Instead of regulatory fiat, enforced by legal prose and human courts backed by the threat of violence; Bitcoin enables a network of peers to create the conditions required for a functional currency through mathematics alone, enforced by deterministic computation. The saying holds this double entendre which implies both that using numbers and mathemtical consensus gives us the strength to lay down what Andreas Antonopolous will later call 'unassailable facts', while also pointing at that which gives power and meaning to any narrative: the community which believes it. The more succinctly we can express shared truths, the easier it becomes to verify (and therefore trust) the systems we use. This implies that \ud83d\udca1 Trust has something to do with truth. Publicly verifiable truth means more humans can reach consensus on the basic state of their shared realities and get on transacting in increasingly valuable ways based on new kinds of trust. It's a profound feedback loop : use a universal language (math) to define succinctly what it means to cheat, enforce penalties in a deterministic and executable way based on your definitions (code), which allows more humans to experiment with interpersonal trust in ways previously unimaginable. To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary. Access-ability Ultimately, we're not interested in trust based on blind faith. We're interested in deterministic verifi ability between peers. The Bitcoin source code can be audited by anyone, anywhere in the world - so it's not just ability we're interested in here, but also access . Trust, in a practical day-to-day sense, has a lot to do with transparency and education. This requires a certain kind of architectual innovation in the very structure of money: no more clients and servers; everyone needs to be a peer. Please take a look over the brief of the next piece of curated material - Money Talks - to get a sense for what a peer-to-peer architecture of money, and waht money as a protocol is really all about. Deeper down the rabbit hole Of course, all this raises the question, \"What is truth?\" Note that we're interested in shared truth above, i.e. consensus. Absolute Truth is beyond the scope of this course, though you can use the same framework to think about it.

As one of the designers who worked on the first iPhone, she has a unique perspective on the ability we have to design both. She also speaks about the US-sanctioned massacres in Indonesia in 1965 - one of the places she originates from - and how these, too, have effected the way she sees the structure of society and what she calls \"dominant narratives.\" \"Instead of thinking of life as a series of checks which I need to tick off - something which can be displayed on a graph that climbs ever up and to the right - I like to think of my life as a canvas which I can paint with whatever weird artwork I feel like [...] Here is my mandatory Venn diagram: the status quo needs to change, and life is short. When we put these two together, we can see that we need to subvert the status quo and have as much fun as possible along the way!\" It's colourful and light and funny, but also a deeply profound point. To illustrate further: the point of meditation is not to get \"good\" at sitting around, thinking about nothing: it is to turn your life into a meditative one. Every act itself a meditation. May Li talks about it in terms of turning the living of life into an artwork. The question is, what is the primary means we have a making art of our lives? This course will contend that it is designing dialogue . Therefore, we turn back and listen further: \"The first example is BBQ Becky, a woman who called the police on black people having a barbecue [... The response was to host a really massive barbecue and] the community has come together, everyone is welcome, thousands of people turned out. There was great food, and dominoes. And now it's a tradition! [...] The second example is called 'futbolistas 4 life' [...] Something that was important for a lot of the students was feeling like they had this space to play; and freedom and ownership over their play and their bodies in a place that felt good [...] 'Having a space like a soccer field where we can play and love one another: that's an act of resistance '.\" In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a society based on fear; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance. Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot. This is why we have unicorns and dancing developers and silly memes: it's not something incidental. It is a fundamental part of what borderless, global history-writing based on consensus is about. The revolution is not being televised because it's not about hate or anger or violence or anything else that grabs the headlines of a media operating with skewed incentives. It's heart to heart, here in the prison yards where we're using matching funds to build playgrounds where we can love again. Small things \"When you do these little, joyful subversions remember that they can be really small. They don't have to be these grandiose events with hundreds or thousands of people. When face-tracking came out, I managed to sneak little pink hearts into your Mac. At that time, there wasn't a lot of pink happening at all [laughs] It makes me happy to think I got Steve Jobs to approve this while pink hearts were coming out his head.

The octahedron is the third of the five solids postulated by Plato to make up all the elements - earth, water, fire, air and aether . While discussing air in the Timaeus - the element with which the octahedron is associated - Plato writes: \"there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1)\". The word \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1 in Homeric Greek means \"pure, fresh air\" or \"clear sky\". It is also often translated as \"quintessence\": the material that fills the region of the universe above the terrestrial sphere. The aether is the air of another realm, which nevertheless interacts with our own by virtue of the meaning we enact in our use of the four terrestrial elements. The octahedron is the middle solid, and therefore associated in more modern metaphysics with the heart; love; compassion; forgiveness; and healing.

Written by Nick Szabo in 2002, it provides a unique window into understanding why blockchains matter beyond the purely monetary applications. How does this fit into KERNEL? That said, we have chosen this essay specifically because it shows how money and trade led to the development of written language - an idea we began exploring with Andreas Antonopoulos in the previous module. Moreover, it speaks directly to Why we should (continue to) build censorship resistant tools How we have always, and can continue to, secure our most valuable communications. Brief \"Let\u2018s distinguish between seals, the often cleverly carved cylinders or stamps that make the impressions, and sealings, the resulting impressions rolled or stamped on wet clay, and the clay they were impressed upon. Sealings of clay were wrapped around rope knots to seal bales of goods, and around the rims of wicker baskets and pottery jars to seal in their contents [...] Seals were carved from hard materials \u2013 usually stone but sometimes faience, glass, metal, wood, or bone. Sometimes sun-dried or baked clay itself was used. The Greeks and Romans used signet rings, their action ends shaped from metal or carved from gems, to stamp wax.\" This may seem a bit random, but data integrity is critical to trade and trust relationships. Without some way to guarantee the quality and provenance of goods, no real trade can occur. \"The earliest stamp seals found were used in Iran in 5,000 B.C. Later on archaeologists can use both the trade in seals themselves, as well as the distances between seals and the corresponding sealings, to trace long-distance trade networks.\" The means of securing our trade, and therefore trust, relationships are also the means by which we can understand the network within which they operate. This is still true today, and provides some neat context for why a shared, global, ownerless, borderless means of recording history is so vital and interesting a development. \"For the Sumerians a business protocol was also a religious ritual, and the reverse was usually true as well. In the Middle East seal breaking became one of the most important of these rituals, with terrifying spiritual consequences if the seal were broken by the wrong person or at the wrong time.\" This may also lack a bit of context right now, but will become important in the final week when we get to Sacred Economics. Until then, read on, because here is the meat of this article - how trade and money lead directly to the development of writing: \"The first documents ever written, in the 4 th millennium B.C., were about wheat and barley, and were sealed. Far earlier still, at least as far back as 8,000 B.C., archeologists have found even more salient artifacts \u2013 vast numbers of little clay tokens [...] Now we know that these tokens led directly to what are now the very basics of our civilization \u2013 reading, writing, and arithmetic. \"Soon after 4,000 B.C., the clay tokens were combined with the idea of sealing to create bills of lading and warehouse receipts. To create a bill of lading for a consignment of sheep, the owner put in a one-sheep token for every sheep. Every time he counted five sheep, a five-sheep token could be substituted for a one-sheep token. Once the owner and the consignee agreed on the count, the tokens were placed in a wet clay envelope. The owner and the consignee rolled their seals over the envelope, then let it dry. [...] The receipt was tokens sealed in an envelope \u2013 when the owner got hungry, or wanted to sell to the hungry, or wanted the seed to plant next spring \u2013 he would take the envelope to the warehouse. The claimant and the warehouse operator would inspect the seal, break it, inspect the tokens, and then deliver the goods. \"It would be nice if one could learn the contents of the envelope \u2013 the number and kind of tokens \u2013 without having to take the ominous and irreversible step of breaking the seal. Around 3,400 B.C. in Sumer, marks started appearing on the outside of these envelopes. These marks were simply made by the tokens themselves. The different shapes and sizes of the tokens created correspondingly unique impressions, and thus the same symbols [...] \"With different tokens for one sheep, five sheep, one pot of barley, five pots of barley, and so forth, we get m * n different tokens [...] By creating separate tokens for the numbers and the goods, the number of different kinds of tokens were reduced to m + n , at the cost of up to twice as many tokens per envelope [...] \"The evolution of writing proceeded from there. A hundred years later reed styluses were being used to mimic the clay token marks. Over the centuries, scribes supplemented or replaced token-derived symbols with pictographs for the objects. The pictographs attempted to depict the object visually. Both kinds of symbols became stylized as wedges, or \u201ccuneiform\u201d, optimized for the reed stylus. Still later, words represented by neither pictographs nor token-derived symbols come to be represented by a rebus.\" And that's all she wrote! Well, not quite, but it is one of the more believable stories about the development of the written word and takes us into the very heart of what it is we're really innovating on in KERNEL. Seals, while historically fascinating, were not the only method of providing evidence of foul play: \"Along with the tamper evident clay, the Sumerians developed a kind of virtual tamper evidence. It took the form of two sets of numbers. On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately \u2013 for example on the front would be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded \u201c265\u201d \u2013 the same objects counted again, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them [...] Checksums still form the basis of modern accounting. Indeed, the principle of double entry bookkeeping is based on two sets of independently derived numbers that must add up to the same number.\" From here, Szabo describes modern means of providing tamper evidence and describes the use of cryptography - that is, secret writing - to provide both unspoofable checksums with one-way hash functions, as well as the development of digital signatures. So, what does this all have to do with Ethereum's state and history? Well, apart from providing the history of our civilizational evolution towards global platforms capable of ensuring data integrity at scales never before possible, which thereby allow for trade in ways and at scales not before possible, it also sets the scene nicely for some of the modules to come. Bitcoin and Ethereum are not some aberration of the digital, technological age: they are the next block in a timeless story about the evolution of trust and its concomitant effect on what it means to be human.

Sealings of clay were wrapped around rope knots to seal bales of goods, and around the rims of wicker baskets and pottery jars to seal in their contents [...] Seals were carved from hard materials \u2013 usually stone but sometimes faience, glass, metal, wood, or bone. Sometimes sun-dried or baked clay itself was used. The Greeks and Romans used signet rings, their action ends shaped from metal or carved from gems, to stamp wax.\" This may seem a bit random, but data integrity is critical to trade and trust relationships. Without some way to guarantee the quality and provenance of goods, no real trade can occur. \"The earliest stamp seals found were used in Iran in 5,000 B.C. Later on archaeologists can use both the trade in seals themselves, as well as the distances between seals and the corresponding sealings, to trace long-distance trade networks.\" The means of securing our trade, and therefore trust, relationships are also the means by which we can understand the network within which they operate. This is still true today, and provides some neat context for why a shared, global, ownerless, borderless means of recording history is so vital and interesting a development. \"For the Sumerians a business protocol was also a religious ritual, and the reverse was usually true as well. In the Middle East seal breaking became one of the most important of these rituals, with terrifying spiritual consequences if the seal were broken by the wrong person or at the wrong time.\" This may also lack a bit of context right now, but will become important in the final week when we get to Sacred Economics. Until then, read on, because here is the meat of this article - how trade and money lead directly to the development of writing: \"The first documents ever written, in the 4 th millennium B.C., were about wheat and barley, and were sealed. Far earlier still, at least as far back as 8,000 B.C., archeologists have found even more salient artifacts \u2013 vast numbers of little clay tokens [...] Now we know that these tokens led directly to what are now the very basics of our civilization \u2013 reading, writing, and arithmetic. \"Soon after 4,000 B.C., the clay tokens were combined with the idea of sealing to create bills of lading and warehouse receipts. To create a bill of lading for a consignment of sheep, the owner put in a one-sheep token for every sheep. Every time he counted five sheep, a five-sheep token could be substituted for a one-sheep token. Once the owner and the consignee agreed on the count, the tokens were placed in a wet clay envelope. The owner and the consignee rolled their seals over the envelope, then let it dry. [...] The receipt was tokens sealed in an envelope \u2013 when the owner got hungry, or wanted to sell to the hungry, or wanted the seed to plant next spring \u2013 he would take the envelope to the warehouse. The claimant and the warehouse operator would inspect the seal, break it, inspect the tokens, and then deliver the goods. \"It would be nice if one could learn the contents of the envelope \u2013 the number and kind of tokens \u2013 without having to take the ominous and irreversible step of breaking the seal. Around 3,400 B.C. in Sumer, marks started appearing on the outside of these envelopes. These marks were simply made by the tokens themselves. The different shapes and sizes of the tokens created correspondingly unique impressions, and thus the same symbols [...] \"With different tokens for one sheep, five sheep, one pot of barley, five pots of barley, and so forth, we get m * n different tokens [...] By creating separate tokens for the numbers and the goods, the number of different kinds of tokens were reduced to m + n , at the cost of up to twice as many tokens per envelope [...] \"The evolution of writing proceeded from there. A hundred years later reed styluses were being used to mimic the clay token marks. Over the centuries, scribes supplemented or replaced token-derived symbols with pictographs for the objects. The pictographs attempted to depict the object visually. Both kinds of symbols became stylized as wedges, or \u201ccuneiform\u201d, optimized for the reed stylus. Still later, words represented by neither pictographs nor token-derived symbols come to be represented by a rebus.\" And that's all she wrote! Well, not quite, but it is one of the more believable stories about the development of the written word and takes us into the very heart of what it is we're really innovating on in KERNEL. Seals, while historically fascinating, were not the only method of providing evidence of foul play: \"Along with the tamper evident clay, the Sumerians developed a kind of virtual tamper evidence. It took the form of two sets of numbers. On the front of the tablet, each group of commodities would be recorded separately \u2013 for example on the front would be recorded 120 pots of wheat, 90 pots of barley, and 55 goats. On the reverse would simply be recorded \u201c265\u201d \u2013 the same objects counted again, probably in a different order, and without bothering to categorize them [...] Checksums still form the basis of modern accounting. Indeed, the principle of double entry bookkeeping is based on two sets of independently derived numbers that must add up to the same number.\" From here, Szabo describes modern means of providing tamper evidence and describes the use of cryptography - that is, secret writing - to provide both unspoofable checksums with one-way hash functions, as well as the development of digital signatures. So, what does this all have to do with Ethereum's state and history? Well, apart from providing the history of our civilizational evolution towards global platforms capable of ensuring data integrity at scales never before possible, which thereby allow for trade in ways and at scales not before possible, it also sets the scene nicely for some of the modules to come. Bitcoin and Ethereum are not some aberration of the digital, technological age: they are the next block in a timeless story about the evolution of trust and its concomitant effect on what it means to be human. Like the Ancient Sumerians prove, nowhere is the ongoing development more obvious than in our application of the twin practices of faith and finance.","title":"Brief"},{"location":"module-1/promise-blockchains/","text":"\ud83d\udcdc Unrecognizable capitalism This video of Vinay Gupta will give you a grand overview of the history of computing from the 1960's onward, and how it applies to the economic and societal systems we have built, and can imagine building in and for a more sustainable future.

It's especially useful to look back and ask what of the original ideas we have succeeded in implementing, and where there are still opportunities for improvement. This video has been selected to assist you deepen your (more technical) understanding of: Value Trust Incentives Censorship resistance (Not just!) money and speech Brief This video is the genesis of the calculator (Bitcoin) vs smartphone (Ethereum) analogy and a demonstration of the power of generality... \"Instead of having a protocol that is designed around one very small set of use cases, you just create a general-purpose operating system and you let people build whatever they want as applications on top of it.\" Ethereum is a blockchain, with a few additions: Built-in Turing-complete scripting language - essentially hybrid between standard VM architectures, Bitcoin script and a \"few other things\". People can write programs in this script, or high level languages that compile down to this script, take these compiled scripts, put them into transactions and send them to the blockchain. The transaction gets confirmed and you get a special account at that address. Contractual accounts and Externally Owned Accounts have the same privileges . Anyone can create an application, with any rules. Anyone can then interact with that application, i.e. you can do NameCoin in 10 lines of code... State is defined as a key value mapping addresses to account objects. Every account object has a nonce and balance. Contract accounts also include a code hash and storage trie root. Vitalik then discusses how transactions work - important low-level details for us to build a full conceptual picture in the weeks ahead. \"You can actually think of it as being a fairly simple system. You can think of the state as being a database, and you can think of each of these contracts as being programs that are sitting on one computer, except the computer is massively globally distributed. It's actually a highly secure network backed by tens of thousands computers around the world. It's bold because it's important.\" However, this raises the spectre of \"The Halting Problem\", which Vitalik explains as being solved by gas: a fee for every computational step the computer must take, where there is a limit to computational steps possible per block. This means there is no technical limit on what can be put in the data field of a transaction, but there is an economic one, as the more data you include, the more expensive it becomes. It was an extra 68gas for every byte of data you include at that time, though it may have changed now. \ud83d\udca1 Exercise for the reader: how would you tell what the gas price per byte currently is? Vitalik then discusses some of the intricacies v , r , and s from elliptic curve cryptography, and how v is an extra field used for public key recovery. He also provides further information on receipts and logs and why logs are cheaper and allow for efficient light-client access. Although it may sound boring, this is the heart of how we build censorship resistance tools. This is followed by a description of the Ethereum Virtual Machine : Stack - up to 1024 32-byte fields. Memory - just an infinitely expanding byte array, but the more you expand the byte array, the more gas you have to pay. Most of the limits aren't static, they're economic and you'll see this idea again and again. Storage - permanent for contracts. You can read and write to it. Environment variables - VM can access block number, time, mining difficulty, previous block hash etc. Logs - append-only storage in a specific block, not in state. Sub-calling - opcode by which VM can itself call other contracts. Then Vitalik discusses ABI and RLP (recursive length prefix) encoding. \"For people who are set theory geeks\". Again, this may seem boring, but it is a demonstration of the early culture and how the people who built all this stuff really think. This is followed by an explanation of memory-hard algorithms for mining and why they were an innovation. Again, worth listening to for cultural context, but 23:50 - 28:57 is now a bit outdated. Vitalik also emphasises the fast block time (17s) and discusses uncles - which solve \"stale rates\" of blocks which arise due to network latency. He makes the critical point that merkle tries are \"a construction that allows for compact, efficiently-verifiable proofs that a particular transaction was included in a particular block.\" It's not just transactions in the Merkle trie though; it's the state too: i.e. that storage trie root we talked about in the account object earlier. Here is why understanding the low-level details allows us to build a comprehensive conceptual picture of how it all ties together. Generalised Compute So, you're less technical then Vitalik (i.e. all of us) and are wondering what this all really means? Well, the critical point is this notion of a general purpose operating system - one, monolithic virtual machine distributed across the world which is shared by everyone, owned by no-one and which can't be turned off without also turning off the internet. Even with Bitcoin, we got this feature that you could carry 12 magical words in your head across any border in the world, incant them into an internet-connected machine and have immediate access to value. Now, there is the possibility that you could pull down not just monetary value, but generalised compute . That is, your 12 or 24-word mnemonic could be your entire personal OS, which would be accessible from anywhere, if we can genuinely create a general-purpose shared history machine which is capable of scaling across the globe.

This is, in a sense, the ultimate question. So, how can we use our new thinking skills based on complementary opposites to break it down and come to some useful insights? \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to pause here and consider it for yourself before reading further... We can begin by asking, \"What destroys value?\" Some suggestions include: inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception, dispersion, hatred. Hopefully you can begin to see why playing with pattern is such a valuable and powerful means of thinking. Instead of egotistically presupposing we can drive straight into a coherent answer, the idea is to explore the space of seeming opposition as this, more often than not, sheds light in surprising ways on the original question. In the same way that building trustless protocols means defining clearly what it means to cheat; we can come to understand far more about value by considering first what it is not. If it is not inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception and hatred, then it seems like trust in clearly shared truths lies at the core of how we might generate valuable interactions between people. Consensus So, how do we create shared truth? The simple answer is: through fiction . People tend to look down on fiction, even though it is really just the lie which reveals truth. What matters most in terms of true value generation is the efficiency of the language you employ to tell your fiction. The legal fiction of the firm resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in our ability to generate value based on new kinds of transactions. It has also ended up being extractive and corrupt, because legal text must be parsed and interpreted by humans, who are error-prone and easy to manipulate; and because legal text is - in fact - enforced by the threat of violence which relies on the asymmetric power of a nation state. Blockchains implement a new kind of mathematical consensus fiction. The core question remains: how many people can reliably share in the truth your fiction reveals, for this defines the constraints of what kinds of value can be generated with it. Narrative Tribal narratives allowed truth to be shared between ~150 people. These evolved into religious myths around the time of the agricultural revolution. It's no coincidence that, concomitant with the spread of the first major religious myths, came the development of writing; the primary use of which was tracking debt. Myth alone is not enough to hold societies larger than your average tribe together: it needs to be paired with a shared record, built around succinct and significant symbols. Without tracing the whole history, one can see how our ability to create value has always been tied to the ways in which we tell stories about, and with, our shared records . However, prior to the feedback loop outlined in trust , the record was maintained by someone , which gives them enormous power and means everyone else is incentivized to try and manipulate them. Because blockchains allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, and because the record itself is shared across all participants, there is a whole new \"trust space\" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions.","title":"Value"},{"location":"module-1/value/#value","text":"What is value? This is, in a sense, the ultimate question. So, how can we use our new thinking skills based on complementary opposites to break it down and come to some useful insights? \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to pause here and consider it for yourself before reading further... We can begin by asking, \"What destroys value?\" Some suggestions include: inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception, dispersion, hatred. Hopefully you can begin to see why playing with pattern is such a valuable and powerful means of thinking. Instead of egotistically presupposing we can drive straight into a coherent answer, the idea is to explore the space of seeming opposition as this, more often than not, sheds light in surprising ways on the original question. In the same way that building trustless protocols means defining clearly what it means to cheat; we can come to understand far more about value by considering first what it is not. If it is not inefficiency, disagreement, fear, deception and hatred, then it seems like trust in clearly shared truths lies at the core of how we might generate valuable interactions between people.","title":"\ud83d\udcaf Value"},{"location":"module-1/value/#consensus","text":"So, how do we create shared truth? The simple answer is: through fiction . People tend to look down on fiction, even though it is really just the lie which reveals truth. What matters most in terms of true value generation is the efficiency of the language you employ to tell your fiction. The legal fiction of the firm resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in our ability to generate value based on new kinds of transactions. It has also ended up being extractive and corrupt, because legal text must be parsed and interpreted by humans, who are error-prone and easy to manipulate; and because legal text is - in fact - enforced by the threat of violence which relies on the asymmetric power of a nation state. Blockchains implement a new kind of mathematical consensus fiction. The core question remains: how many people can reliably share in the truth your fiction reveals, for this defines the constraints of what kinds of value can be generated with it.","title":"Consensus"},{"location":"module-1/value/#narrative","text":"Tribal narratives allowed truth to be shared between ~150 people. These evolved into religious myths around the time of the agricultural revolution. It's no coincidence that, concomitant with the spread of the first major religious myths, came the development of writing; the primary use of which was tracking debt. Myth alone is not enough to hold societies larger than your average tribe together: it needs to be paired with a shared record, built around succinct and significant symbols. Without tracing the whole history, one can see how our ability to create value has always been tied to the ways in which we tell stories about, and with, our shared records . However, prior to the feedback loop outlined in trust , the record was maintained by someone , which gives them enormous power and means everyone else is incentivized to try and manipulate them.

It's now time to look in greater detail at money as it actually works in the modern economy. And it's really difficult to do this, because any classical economics textbook - even from the 1960's - is already outdated. The best resource we know, which is able to take both a long, historical perspective, but then ground it in the day-to-day realities of money and banking as they actually work in our era, is this course from Perry Mehrling and the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Only the 3 rd , 4 th ,9 th and 10 th videos are briefed here, but if this interests you, then you have another 100 or so videos to go through when you find time. How this fits into KERNEL You cannot ask better questions unless you understand something deeply. You cannot understand how to disrupt banks and the current financial system unless you know how we got here and what it actually is. This series grounds value, money, speech, and incentives in very real-world, practical terms. Literally the entire course is aimed at teaching you how to read the Financial Times and translate it into everyday language for your friends. While not a core learning objective for KERNEL, Mehrling approaches money and banking through the issue of liquidity , rather than solvency, and this is particularly relevant for anyone working on DeFi. Brief \" The analytical apparatus of this course is largely balance sheets. \" \"The two key ideas in this course are thinking of banking as a clearing systems - a payment system - and banking as market making. Additionally, banking as advanced clearing is how we bring in finance and forwards and futures and swaps and derivatives etc.\" If you watch the whole course, you'll see Mehrling use the classic T account over and over again to explain increasingly complex concepts. You'll realise that the T account - or balance sheet-style thinking - is just the banker's way of being able to hold in mind complementary opposites and demand, very practically, that they balance each other out. It is a powerful, and simple, way of understanding the flow of value anywhere in the world. Banks and shadows Mehrling starts by describing a simple bank: with loans, securities and cash as its assets; and deposits, \"other borrowing\", and a balancing item of \"net worth\" as its liabilities. If this seems familiar and boring, stay with it, because this course is really about that strange term \"other borrowing\", how it relates to the money markets, overnight lending, FedWire and shadow banks - all the stuff you were never taught about because they didn't exist in the form they now take, especially post-2008. Moreover, instead of focusing on a positive \"Net Worth\" - i.e. the solvency of banks - Mehrling is going to be looking at that Tamil word for Chinese money: cash and the liquidity problem, because this is actually the constraint bankers have to face at the end of every day when they \"clear\" their accounts. In many ways Mehrling's course is about payment systems and how they work in practice, and this is why it's so relevant in the context of peer-to-peer electronic payment systems, or open protocols for money. We have to understand liquidity and the different prices of money if we are to appreciate what it actually means to have a payment system which no-one controls, because it is ultimately these two constraints which will define what kinds of programmable money are useful, and what kinds will fail. \"We're also going to be talking about shadow banks , [by which I mean] an entity that is holding Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (loans that have been turned into a kind of bond), or Interest Rate Swaps and Credit Default Swaps to mitigate risk so that what is left is a short-term, relatively low risk asset that can be used as collateral for borrowing in the wholesale money market [...] So, you have money market borrowing as the liability. They're not borrowing from you and me, but from money market mutual funds and big corporate investors. The instruments they're using are things like Repurchase Agreements, Eurodollars (or LIBOR), and Asset-Backed Commercial Paper. The point is: this model is now the dominant one . The amount of credit in the US that runs through this method is much larger than through traditional banks, which is what the textbooks are all about.\" Shadow banking also faces the issues of solvency and liquidity, but it's more complex than in the regular system because the issue of liquidity is really about being able to roll over the funding for your RMBS, IRS and CDS. If the money markets freeze up, you can't roll it over and you have to liquidate. This is what a lot of the 2008 financial crisis was about. The course looks in great detail at the Federal Reserve, which is also a bank. Mehrling begins by discussing a 2012 Fed balance sheet and, for instance, the $852 Billion of mortgage backed securities it was carrying then. Very pertinently, Mehrling shows how \"It's just not correct to say that the Fed is 'printing money'. When it is expanding the money supply, it is expanding both sides of the balance sheet . It is a classic banking operation, which happens at all levels of the system.\" Whether you agree that it should happen is another story, but Mehrling takes great care to place himself in an esteemed intellectual tradition in the previous two videos which may make you rethink your position. In any case: \"The system has changed dramatically. When people talk about Quantitative Easing 1, QE 2, QE 3 - they're talking about the transformation of the Fed's balance sheet that I am showing you.\" The 4 prices of money If we're really going to understand banking as a payment system - as well as the mechanics which underpin market making as a valuable activity - we need to understand what the different prices of money are and how they come about. Interest rate (future) - this is the price of money most economists focus on. It is the price of money now in terms of money later. It's how you transform money today into money tomorrow. However, there is a more primitive price which gets neglected in most thinking: Par (now) - the price of one money in terms of another money right now. We take it for granted that demand deposits and cash reserves in a bank trade at par. In financial crises, sometimes par is broken; where private money trades at a different price to central bank money. The hybridity of our system is masked by par, but it raises the question of why does par actually work? Par is critical to the payments system - i.e. par clearing between different states (for instance) was created by the Fed. It's not easy to create this, because it is akin to a fixed price, which spooks economists. Just ask the people at MakerDAO. Exchange rate (foreign) - the price of domestic money in terms of foreign, or world reserve, money. Which leads us to realise that there are, in fact, two dollars. This is well highlighted in the Triffin dilemma . Price level (commodities) - economists often reference this, imagining that the quantity of money moves one-to-one with the price level of commodities. \"In this course, we will not be taking sides - pro-banker vs anti-banker - we'll be trying to figure out how the system works so that we can approach this as scientists and citizens. The world has changed: it's a global financial world. The world of 1950's textbooks is not a world with private capital markets, and it's also not global, because the global markets of the 19 th Century had broken down. Bagehot is a better guide for today than Irving Fischer.\" That last sentence is the economist's version of a very hot take. Mehrling has a unique point of view which will assist you to uncover the actual inner workings of the \"tribe of bankers\" and how they think about the world so that you can program money both to account for the problems they're actually solving, and go a step further towards a more equitable world in which the bottom line is not the only thing we try to optimize. Mehrling is trying to connect the world of Finance and Banking, so we can move towards a more holistic understanding of the overall system. His motto for doing this is simple: \" All banking is a swap of IOUs . By swap, I mean IRS, CDS and the like, but also loans. The world of finance thinks they understand everything about swaps - derivatives etc. - but we're not going to be thinking of swaps in the terms finance people do, we'll be thinking of them in the way money people do, in that there is a funding and liquidity piece to swaps and that liquidity piece is what drives all the action [...] This is all about the question, 'What does financial globalization imply for money and monetary theory'? We're trying to develop monetary theory for the real world that is around us now.\" Discipline and elasticity We recommend going to videos 9 and 10 next. Thinking in terms of liquidity and payment systems reveals a deep tension between fiscal discipline and elasticity . Mehrling introduces the image of a pyramid, made up of different kinds of money - ranging from Federal Reserve notes at the top, to credit instruments at the base. These two big picture principles - discipline and elasticity - are continued usefully in video 25. The critical point for our present study is that this beating heart, and the tension between elasticity and discipline, is currently managed by a group of unelected bureaucrats at the Fed. This is - to use Mehrling's phrase - neither a good nor a bad thing; it is a fact thing. They attempt to control the inevitable expansions and contractions through interest rates and various other, more contentious methods; like expanding the balance sheet and buying Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities and similar private instruments. If you're interested in why this is potentially not the optimal way to manage a global system, please read this book . Most importantly, programmable money means that we can code our financial systems to be responsive in ways which the current system simply cannot be. We can program stability in ways previously unimaginable. But, we have to understand how hard that really is, why it is so hard, and what the trade-offs in achieving it have been throughout history. This is not about destroying central banks - Mehrling will convince you of how useful they are (preservation of par being but one example). This is about changing the kind of money that sits on top of the pyramid from Federal Reserve notes to an ownerless, borderless, global, peer-to-peer ledger which holds us all equally accountable. It is about changing the ways in which critical financial organizations can respond to the needs of an global and interconnected system, and removing the possibility of corruption and manipulation to the greatest extent possible with the technology we have available. Further Recommendations Go to video 16 for more information on the deep links between money and violence - in this case the fascinating history of the Fed and the Civil War. Go to video 28 to see a worked example of balance sheet-style thinking that will explain to you how credit cards actually work (fair warning: it's a mess). This snippet will help you understand source and use accounts, and how to think about money in both micro and macro economics. If you've got this far, you should just watch the whole course in your own time. I learned a lot from the videos starting at 72 - Dealers and Liquid Security Markets. 101 is also a treat.

Good questions must come from a sincere desire to learn, rather than as a veiled means of stating your own opinion. Experts rarely ask good questions. Be a beginner, always. Questions are an opportunity to be humbled. Asking good questions is indistinguishable from practicing humility . Own up to what you don't know. It will set others free and you may end up coming closer to the shared truths which are a hallmark of honest conversation between peers. Close listening and clear attention are preconditions for good questions. A real master is the pupil in the eye of the world. Don't be afraid of letting others teach you; it does not degrade you, it uplifts you. The ego doesn't always acknowledge this simple truth. Asking better questions is about process and practice . It's something you need to work on consciously. It is a skill, not an innate personality trait and it can be developed in much the same way that you can become better at coding, or cooking, or gardening, or meditation. This goes to the heart of the thinking methodology we're advocating here. If you're able to identify patterns of meaning by considering the complementary opposites implied by any idea you are presented with, you will naturally ask better, simpler, and more direct questions. The starting point is to ask yourself, \"What does this really mean ?\" It's not about \"How can I use this?\" or \"Why is everyone else excited?\" It's about whether you can understand the basic principles. If you can't, it's either because it's not a well-formed idea (in which case, move on!) or because you need to learn a new skill in order to understand its implications. Which implies, again, that you need to be willing to learn if you are to practice the art of asking better questions. How do you develop a willingness to learn? It begins with clarity and honesty about what you don't know. As soon as you stop hiding behind all the ego's pretenses and claims to knowledge, you will realise how little each of us actually knows. Such honesty automatically makes you more incentivized to improve yourself, because no-one likes feeling inept (even though we all are). In so doing, you can begin to experience the benefits of beginner's mind yourself, not conceptually, but in the actual course of your life. Beginner's mind is about starting now, trying for yourself, being frustrated by your lack of expertise, and letting your heart show your mind how to celebrate this fecund state of not-knowing - for therein lies both truth and liberation.

If you can't, it's either because it's not a well-formed idea (in which case, move on!) or because you need to learn a new skill in order to understand its implications. Which implies, again, that you need to be willing to learn if you are to practice the art of asking better questions. How do you develop a willingness to learn? It begins with clarity and honesty about what you don't know. As soon as you stop hiding behind all the ego's pretenses and claims to knowledge, you will realise how little each of us actually knows. Such honesty automatically makes you more incentivized to improve yourself, because no-one likes feeling inept (even though we all are). In so doing, you can begin to experience the benefits of beginner's mind yourself, not conceptually, but in the actual course of your life. Beginner's mind is about starting now, trying for yourself, being frustrated by your lack of expertise, and letting your heart show your mind how to celebrate this fecund state of not-knowing - for therein lies both truth and liberation.","title":"\u2049\ufe0f Asking Better Questions"},{"location":"module-2/better-questions/#further-references","text":"Unsolicited Advice We highly recommend you treat yourself to these unsolicited life lessons from Kevin Kelly.

Too often, the people disrupting any industry don't understand deeply what it is they're disrupting. This is definitely the case with cryptocurrencies and the current financial system. It really is well worth your time to stop and become familiar with more history so that you can understand why we are where we are, what led us here, and - only then - what solutions might actually benefit you and those you care about. We'll provide you with a highly summarized version of the talk below, but recommend that you set aside some time and watch the full thing. How does this fit into KERNEL? We're trying to provide as broad a perspective as possible on money, speech, value and trust: the core ideas which lie at the heart of building global, borderless, ownerless and decentralized products, services and protocols. Most importantly, you can't just hate on debt: you need to understand what it actually is and how we got to a world which runs on it and where we sit with a current global debt of $188 trillion. Brief Debt and morality \"[The book] grapples with a moral and political problem, which is: 'What is this hold that the idea of debt has over people's imaginations; that morality itself comes to be thought of as a matter of paying one's debts?'\" Graeber begins with a personal story and describes the \"Drop the Debt\" Campaign, or \"Jubilee 2000\". He was perplexed by most people's seemingly common-sensical notion that everyone absolutely should be expected to pay their debts, no matter what. He feels differently, and so began researching the history of debt, and discovered some surprising things. In particular: \"No-one has ever written a history of debt [...] You do find histories of money, which turn out to be mostly about coinage, which is interesting given that the vast majority of transactions through history have been on credit [...] and you do find histories of credit, but it's not exactly the same thing [...] I have found that most of our basic, common-sense assumptions about debt are completely wrong and that the moral ambivalence typified by the 'but you just have to pay your debts' conversation has been happening for about 5,000 years.\" We move from here into a discussion of Plato's Republic, the question \"What is justice?\" and how the book - like most major religions - takes the structure of 'OK, it's not that, maybe something else then?'. This is the style of thinking we pointed to in Trust - you approach the truth only by negation. On this note: \"Debt, guilt, and sin are actually the same word in Sanskrit - i.e. life itself is a cosmic debt we owe to the gods [...] You owe a debt to your parents, so you become a parent; you owe a debt to the sages, so you become wise; you owe a debt to humanity, so you become humane. But this becomes absurd when we extend it - you're not really paying it back, even though the debt is annihilated by such action [...] Once you figure out what [the Vedas] are really saying it's that, in fact, you are the cosmos and so there can be no such thing as debt. \"The same thing happens in the Bible. In Arameic, the word for debt and sin is also the same word. Actually the Lord's Prayer - which we remember translated into terms of private property - is 'Forgive us our debts, just as we forgive those whom are indebted to us' [...] So what is sacred isn't actually paying back debts, it's forgiveness of debts .\" Put aside any institutional religious difficulties the above passages may present you with for a moment and see this point as it really is. \"Debt forgiveness is, in fact, a tradition going back to Mesopotamia and the Biblical Jubilee. It was considered a divine act [...] Over and over, we find this situation in our civilizational stories where people start with the assumption that debt and morality are the same, and then they are forced to accept that they aren't and have to cast around for some other basis for a universal morality, often encountering great difficulty along the way. It's even more complicated, because when you do think of debt as sin, there is a question of who is the sinner? \" Graeber references a Japanese Buddhist story to highlight this point. Stories like these are best listened to yourself (14:23). The problem it highlights is the moral peril on either side of a debt transaction and the ambivalence it reveals in the very nature of human sociality. Most interestingly, if we're concerned with the level of human exchange, then we only have a relationship with the other when the exchange is incomplete, i.e. when there is debt . The key to maintaining relationships in many older traditions is based on this ambivalence. Someone will give you something and the expectation is that you will give them something in return, though not something of exactly the same value as that would indicate you no longer wish to relate with them. A healthy community is one in which everybody is a little bit in debt to everyone else - it gives us an excuse to see each other! Communal credit \"97% of all transactions in England up until the 17 th Century were by credit. This was partly because there wasn't a lot of currency floating around, and partly because actual money is associated with violence, war and soldiers. Nice people operate on credit and trust.\" Of course, keeping a running ledger in your head of all your debts quickly becomes challenging, hence every half-year or year they would hold \"communal reckonings\", cancel the debt they could, and pay back the amounts still outstanding after a few loops. \"That's community! Community means everybody owes everybody else something and everybody remembers what they owe and eventually they all settle it and start over again. In this sense, debt isn't a terrible thing, but there's still this shadow of sin floating over it. Where does that come from? More generally: a debt is a promise which you can phrase in exactly quantifiable terms. Because you can quantify it, it's impersonal, and therefore transferable. According to some theories, this is what money actually is: a transferable promise. One of the great questions is how this came about? Why is there a need to quantify promises precisely?\" Adam Smith attempted a detailed description of this in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations, which has been accepted as the Economics 101 argument everyone now knows (and which you find in Shelling Out). However, it's not true if you take an accurate anthropological view of history. This false story starts with barter, which runs into the problem of coincidence of wants and the need to settle on one general equivalent and, through a virtuous feedback loop, this then becomes the standard and turns into money. The only problem with this story is that we have never found any evidence for an entirely barter-based society. The core issue here is the assumption that neolithic people would've only engaged in spot trades, which is not the case if we look at the anthropological evidence. In most societies, if someone praises your possession, it's almost impossible not to give it to them. Like debt, this phenomenon exerts a strange moral power over many people, even in the modern world. Graeber tells a Maori story here also worth listening to yourself (26:21). In these sorts of communities, there is definitely a quantified ranking system: a cow is roughly like a canoe is roughly like a good necklace. People can shirk this in all sorts of ways (because favors need not be repaid in a purely material sense), but if you do, you earn a reputation as a cheap skate, which is devastating in small communities. However, it is not possible to say exactly how cheap you are. Graeber then asks: \"How does this rough credit system - which we actually observe in places without money - turn into a system with exact proportional equivalence? The answer seems to be: when someone is really angry. When people are being nice to each other, there's no need to calculate [...] Very often it is the case, even in places where you don't have markets for goods, you do have very elaborate fines for personal damages [...] what they call the barbarian law code [...] So, in legal situations where there is the danger of a feud or outbreak of violence, people do need to quantify. This is the first circumstance in which something like money emerges.\" Currency and violence \"The association between money and violence is a constant and it helps to explain a lot about why debt takes on this incredibly powerful moral hold. If you are in a situation of violent inequality, probably the most effective technique ever invented to make it seem not only moral, but to make it seem like the victim is to blame, is to frame it in the language of debt .\" Mafiosi and the heads of conquering armies understand this all too well. Interestingly, taxes were only placed on conquered populations: they owe the debt of their lives and the conquerors get to be magnanimous benefactors while the victims end up subjugated for long periods. It's happened throughout history. However, history also proves that this eventually blows up in the victor's faces. This is because debt occurs between two parties who are at least potentially equal. Moses Finlay said that there was only one revolutionary program throughout antiquity, which was 'Cancel the debts and redistribute the land.' \"Why does debt motivate people across all ages in this way? Because it implies that you're equal! This is the inevitable conclusion of claiming that debt is morality. Suddenly the language of debt becomes all-pervasive, because you have to use the master's language and I think that's what we're dealing with in all these religious and philosophical texts which start by saying that debt is morality, but then end up saying, 'well, actually, it's not'. It's also why all this moral language becomes financial language, if you think about redemption and reckoning and so on. We're stuck with this language of debt, except that it periodically blows up.\" Remember that the story of barter \u2192 money \u2192 credit is not only wrong, it's backwards. We go back to ancient Sumer to discuss not just the clay tokens used to make the documents Szabo mentioned last week , but the fact that they're recording compounding interest rates. The evidence for this version of the story is scales , which - despite the available technology - were not accurate enough for small, daily amounts: i.e. people were running tabs. To avoid periodic social upheavals, or after winning wars etc., kings would declare a \"clean slate\" and wipe all (consumer) debt. This becomes systematized in the Biblical jubilee (every 7 to 49 years, depending on your reading). \ud83d\udca1 The first recorded word for freedom in any human language is the Sumerian 'ama-gi' which literally means 'return to mother', because that's what happened. Debt cancellation meant all the debt peons got to go home. It's bold because it's important. Virtual money, coins, and an ancient global system \"This virtual money system comes first, which is always entertaining because people have this tendency to write about virtual money as a new phenomena, as if we're in this brave new world, but actually it's the original form of money . Coins come later. Barter only tends to show up where you have people who are used to using money, but can't get their hands on any [...] \"Coins are an interesting case, because they appear in different places using different physical techniques, though the social situations were the same. In all cases, money in the physical sense - currency - is invented to pay soldiers.\" Graeber explains the reasons for this and demonstrates how cash markets - where they do emerge - tend to be in the regions where armies are parked. Governments quickly adopt this (another aspect of this story more convincing than barter, which cannot account for why governments demanded taxes in physical currency), because - in essence - it allows them to employ the entire population to get armies the things they need to survive and fight. \"Money and taxes have been used through the centuries as ways of creating markets. Which is interesting because we have this assumption that markets and governments are opposed principles and that political choice is largely about which one we are going to slant to: free markets or governments [...] Historically, in fact, markets tend to be created by governments as a side-effect of military operations. \"Coinage is invented around 600 BC in what Karl Jaspers called 'the axial age'. He pointed out that most major schools of philosophy and world religions developed in the exact same time and places where we invented coinage [...] World religions arise largely as peace movements against these empires that are using coins to fund armies.\" We're back to complementary opposites: in exactly the same place where we see the development of impersonal markets based on physical currency, we see the development of religions which emphasize the lack of importance in material goods. Gradually though, the empires dissolve, try to adopt religion - which doesn't really work - and we get the Middle Ages where all the gold is put into churches and monasteries, most people go back to local trust, and religions take over the regulation of elaborate credit systems. \"For example, most transactions in the market in Basra from 800 or 900 were done by cheque. This gives an interesting perspective on global markets; which are also nothing new. Cheque is, in fact, an Arabic word [and] cash is a Tamil word for Chinese money. How did that happen? [...] Again, it's not true that we reverted to barter in the Middle Ages [...] We used Roman money until Charlemagne, who never actually got around to making pounds though people still used them to measure. They actually called it imaginary money: an ideal system which spanned Europe with which you could trade on the basis of money that didn't exist. We even had a phenomena called 'crying up' or 'crying down' the currency, by which the king dictated value.\" He then discusses paper money in China and the move toward public currency, versus privatization in the Islamic world. It was Islam which led to the first real free market ideology. It's not about competition \"Adam Smith got most of his ideas and best lines from medieval Islam - like the pin factory, which actually comes from Al-Ghazzali in 1100 who spoke of a needle factory. It was made possible by shariah - civil law which bans usury and operates outside the purview of the state. As a result, we got the first true free markets. You could write a cheque in Mali and cash it in Indonesia and we get, for the first time, the idea that markets can run by themselves. But , since they have a real free market, which isn't enforced by the state, they don't assume it's about competition. The assumption is that it's all an extension of mutual aid .\" Again, a profound and unexpected point that surfaces as a result of studying the actual history. There is so much more to be said about Islam, but we'll leave that for a junto. The world worked like this, except for Western Europe which was a barbarian backwater, until 1492 when a lot of new gold flowed in from the Americas; slavery came back, large empires came back and - to cut a long story short - that's the period which is ending now. 1971 and Bretton Woods is taken by most to be the key point of transition. We get credit cards and cashless transactions taking over in a generation, far more focus on financial capital, \"credit is gonna save the world and micro-credit will save the third world\", 401k's and mortgages and everything else which blew up in 2008. The question is, again, why ? \"The reason is because we're doing things backward. If we look at this from a broad, historical perspective, what we learn is that whenever you have a system of virtual money - in which money is not a thing, but a promise - you have to set up some mechanism to protect debtors. You could have periodic debt cancellation, or anti-usury laws and profit-sharing. Usually it's some kind of giant cosmological system beyond the purview of any state or king. We do set up giant, overarching institutions like this today, but we do so in the form of the IMF, which protects creditors against debtors. All these backward institutions produce the idea that nobody should ever default, which is absurd.\" In such a system, the distinction between actual slavery, and being so in debt that you sell yourself or your time every day is just a legalistic one. However, we're talking about 500 year cycles here, people are beginning to wake up, and we still have time to get it right. \"If democracy is to mean anything, it ought to mean that everybody gets to weigh in on what sort of promises are made, what sort of promises are kept, and - when circumstances change - what sort of promises are renegotiated. That's the political moment that we're in right now.\" Questions The Q A begins at 59:40. The first question has to do with what sort of risk-free rate of return on investment Graeber would impose in his perfect society, considering things like natural spoilage. That is, does money necessarily have to grow? \"Our entire perspective on what money should do goes back to arguments in the Middle Ages. Since usury was illegal, they came up with interest, which was really a late fee. You were not renting money, which is evil, but charging people for failure to return it on the basis that you could've earned ~5% by investing it had they returned it [...] But, I actually do think a jubilee would be reasonable. I end the book by throwing that out [...] because the very idea would allow us to reconceptualize what we're doing and realise that money isn't what we thought it was .\" The Boston Consulting Group actually modeled the idea of a jubilee and concluded that it would cause significant economic disruption, but rather less than if we didn't do it. \"I think we should start thinking about radically different forms of money entirely. Interest-free systems would be possible. The reason Islamic Banking doesn't work is because not everybody's doing it.\" Is there any precedent for the sheer amount of debt across the globe today? \"Probably not, though there have been many speculative bubbles. The real mystery is who is it all owed to? Everyone seems to be in debt, which is puzzling, in a way.\" Graeber references the Midnight Notes Collective and their notion of the 2 phases of capitalism after WWII. Since the 70's there has been a crisis of inclusion in the social benefits and welfare handed out in phase 1 and \"the deal\" is clearly off. Hence, we decouple wages and productivity, and give everyone political rights (which don't imply economic benefits anymore), but you can have credit . Again, everyone wants in on this deal, and the system inevitably implodes. Next question: if we protect the debtors, why pay back debt at all? \"If the government had paid back mortgages, that would also have bailed out the banks, but they chose not to and gave the money directly to the banks. This a pattern we see throughout world history: debt means something totally different depending on who it is between . Between equals, debt is just a broad moral feeling that you should come through. Between the big players, it's the same story. However, what seems to be treated as 'sacred' is not debt between equals, but debts between the people on top and the people on the bottom. All of a sudden it takes on a different color [...] The philosophy of debt as something which cannot be forgiven only ever crops up in situations of structural coercion and extreme inequality. \" How much of our sense of debt is biological, how much of it is from society and how much of it is regulatory? The answer is a bit tangential, but importantly, Graeber says: \"When you try to justify things in terms of the 'big picture', that's when you fall back on the language of debt and reciprocity. People tend to use this language to justify social relationships which operate according to completely different principles.\" Using massive foreclosures in SF as an example, what would it look like to build a movement for a jubilee? \"The vast majority of social movements throughout history have been about debt [...] The problem with organizing debtors politically is that debt is very alienating. Most people with student loan debt or mortgage debt don't actually know many others in the same situation and there is no forum to compare notes and come up with common strategies.\"","title":"Debt"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#debt","text":"This is a long video, but it has been selected nonetheless for two important reasons: It presents a different, and perhaps even more informed, view of the development of money than either Szabo or Antonopolous, which is worth taking into account.

[...] Again, it's not true that we reverted to barter in the Middle Ages [...] We used Roman money until Charlemagne, who never actually got around to making pounds though people still used them to measure. They actually called it imaginary money: an ideal system which spanned Europe with which you could trade on the basis of money that didn't exist. We even had a phenomena called 'crying up' or 'crying down' the currency, by which the king dictated value.\" He then discusses paper money in China and the move toward public currency, versus privatization in the Islamic world. It was Islam which led to the first real free market ideology.","title":"Virtual money, coins, and an ancient global system"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#its-not-about-competition","text":"\"Adam Smith got most of his ideas and best lines from medieval Islam - like the pin factory, which actually comes from Al-Ghazzali in 1100 who spoke of a needle factory. It was made possible by shariah - civil law which bans usury and operates outside the purview of the state. As a result, we got the first true free markets. You could write a cheque in Mali and cash it in Indonesia and we get, for the first time, the idea that markets can run by themselves. But , since they have a real free market, which isn't enforced by the state, they don't assume it's about competition. The assumption is that it's all an extension of mutual aid .\" Again, a profound and unexpected point that surfaces as a result of studying the actual history. There is so much more to be said about Islam, but we'll leave that for a junto. The world worked like this, except for Western Europe which was a barbarian backwater, until 1492 when a lot of new gold flowed in from the Americas; slavery came back, large empires came back and - to cut a long story short - that's the period which is ending now. 1971 and Bretton Woods is taken by most to be the key point of transition. We get credit cards and cashless transactions taking over in a generation, far more focus on financial capital, \"credit is gonna save the world and micro-credit will save the third world\", 401k's and mortgages and everything else which blew up in 2008. The question is, again, why ? \"The reason is because we're doing things backward. If we look at this from a broad, historical perspective, what we learn is that whenever you have a system of virtual money - in which money is not a thing, but a promise - you have to set up some mechanism to protect debtors. You could have periodic debt cancellation, or anti-usury laws and profit-sharing. Usually it's some kind of giant cosmological system beyond the purview of any state or king. We do set up giant, overarching institutions like this today, but we do so in the form of the IMF, which protects creditors against debtors. All these backward institutions produce the idea that nobody should ever default, which is absurd.\" In such a system, the distinction between actual slavery, and being so in debt that you sell yourself or your time every day is just a legalistic one. However, we're talking about 500 year cycles here, people are beginning to wake up, and we still have time to get it right. \"If democracy is to mean anything, it ought to mean that everybody gets to weigh in on what sort of promises are made, what sort of promises are kept, and - when circumstances change - what sort of promises are renegotiated. That's the political moment that we're in right now.\"","title":"It's not about competition"},{"location":"module-2/debt/#questions","text":"The Q A begins at 59:40. The first question has to do with what sort of risk-free rate of return on investment Graeber would impose in his perfect society, considering things like natural spoilage. That is, does money necessarily have to grow? \"Our entire perspective on what money should do goes back to arguments in the Middle Ages. Since usury was illegal, they came up with interest, which was really a late fee. You were not renting money, which is evil, but charging people for failure to return it on the basis that you could've earned ~5% by investing it had they returned it [...] But, I actually do think a jubilee would be reasonable. I end the book by throwing that out [...] because the very idea would allow us to reconceptualize what we're doing and realise that money isn't what we thought it was .\" The Boston Consulting Group actually modeled the idea of a jubilee and concluded that it would cause significant economic disruption, but rather less than if we didn't do it. \"I think we should start thinking about radically different forms of money entirely. Interest-free systems would be possible. The reason Islamic Banking doesn't work is because not everybody's doing it.\" Is there any precedent for the sheer amount of debt across the globe today? \"Probably not, though there have been many speculative bubbles. The real mystery is who is it all owed to? Everyone seems to be in debt, which is puzzling, in a way.\" Graeber references the Midnight Notes Collective and their notion of the 2 phases of capitalism after WWII. Since the 70's there has been a crisis of inclusion in the social benefits and welfare handed out in phase 1 and \"the deal\" is clearly off. Hence, we decouple wages and productivity, and give everyone political rights (which don't imply economic benefits anymore), but you can have credit . Again, everyone wants in on this deal, and the system inevitably implodes. Next question: if we protect the debtors, why pay back debt at all? \"If the government had paid back mortgages, that would also have bailed out the banks, but they chose not to and gave the money directly to the banks. This a pattern we see throughout world history: debt means something totally different depending on who it is between . Between equals, debt is just a broad moral feeling that you should come through. Between the big players, it's the same story. However, what seems to be treated as 'sacred' is not debt between equals, but debts between the people on top and the people on the bottom. All of a sudden it takes on a different color [...] The philosophy of debt as something which cannot be forgiven only ever crops up in situations of structural coercion and extreme inequality. \" How much of our sense of debt is biological, how much of it is from society and how much of it is regulatory? The answer is a bit tangential, but importantly, Graeber says: \"When you try to justify things in terms of the 'big picture', that's when you fall back on the language of debt and reciprocity. People tend to use this language to justify social relationships which operate according to completely different principles.\" Using massive foreclosures in SF as an example, what would it look like to build a movement for a jubilee? \"The vast majority of social movements throughout history have been about debt [...] The problem with organizing debtors politically is that debt is very alienating. Most people with student loan debt or mortgage debt don't actually know many others in the same situation and there is no forum to compare notes and come up with common strategies.\"","title":"Questions"},{"location":"module-2/engineering/","text":"\ud83d\udc8e Engineering money This Andreas Antonopoulos talk goes into more detail about the critical features of money and what being able to engineer them really means.

We've looked at the alternative story of debt, the deep mythic and religious roots money and morality have in our human story, the link between physical currency and violence, and ancient virtual monies and global trade networks.

Yes, this means that there are all sorts of interesting high-level use cases to go after, but it also implies that the only way genuinely to do so is by thinking about the incentives which underpin whatever you want to build. If you're not altering the incentive structure on which your society runs, you should probably just use a database. \"One of our biggest problems is understanding the terms we use, and money is probably the most relevant example of this. Very few people understand what it is and how it works.

Most importantly, there is always a trade-off between the three. Gold is a great store of value, but a lousy medium of exchange. Visa is a great medium of exchange, but not really a unit of account, or a store of value (as it generally represents a form of debt). When you throw tokens on a blockchain into the mix, things become really confusing, and this is because we're using a descriptive term - \"money\" - without differentiating between its actual uses. How do we decide which \"things\" satisfy the trade-off between these three critical features in the most optimal way? We consider: scarcity, portability, durability, fungibility, divisibility, acceptability and stability. In this context: \"Metals aren't very good money, because they have some intrinsic value which is separate from the money it represents. Silver and gold can be traded independently for aesthetic reasons or other purposes. This destroys its fundamental function as a medium of exchange. \" This is a profound point: most people will tell you that intrinsic value is required to make money \"money\", but the truth is almost the exact opposite. Money is an abstraction, which allows us to speak meaningfully about the value of different items otherwise unrelated. If the medium we use to express such transactional relationship has its own intrinsic value, it is not a very functional abstraction. Changing the nature of control \"Metals represented for humanity an era when we used the materials we found around us in the world and adapted them to the uses for which they fit [...] Human beings looked around at found objects in the world and asked 'How do we take these materials that we have and find suitable uses for them?'

We began interacting with nature at a molecular level, turning wood into charcoal, or metal into alloys with unique properties better suited to our needs. Then came the ability to effect the atomic nature of materials: synthetic fertilizers, fabrics, and plastics etc. This is no longer about just finding materials and adapting them to our needs; it's about creating materials which fit uses we have preconceived . Today, we can effect the subatomic structure of things - manipulating nature at the nano scale to create carbon nanotubes etc. That is, we are not just manipulating the atomic behaviour of materials; we are giving them new physical properties. \"We just did something similarly amazing to money.

We accepted the compromise implicit in each type because we could not change its fundamental nature. Take paper money: great medium of exchange and unit of account; really terrible store of value because of its control architecture (don't tell your kids what inflation really does!).

This is because these two features have as much to do with social contracts and the unit in which we choose to measure as they do with technical protocols. Andreas' argument is that we can use abstract monetary protocols which we can engineer to gradually change higher-order social contracts. New conversations \"Now that we don't have to adapt to compromises, but can engineer trade-offs away, how about we invent some characteristics of money that have never existed before?

How does this fit into KERNEL? This has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Reciprocal altruism and the problem of cooperation. The deep evolutionary links between money , mnemonics and genetic, generational memory. The importance of incentive structures to greater cooperation throughout human history. How money has been used in situations of low trust to enable trade that would otherwise not have occurred. Brief \"The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot \u2013 including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics \u2013 they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.\" Szabo begins with a story about the problems faced by the early colonists of America, who had limited access to the \"coin of the realm\", which was used to ensure they remained loyal subjects of the crown. They solved this by adopting the form of money used by the majority of Native Americans: wampum (or clam) shells. This strategy was so successful, and trade in wampum so widely accepted, that wampum became legal tender in New England from 1637 to 1661. Eventually the British shipped more coins to America and this practice ceased. \"The American language of shell money became a quaint holdover \u2013 \"a hundred clams\" became \"a hundred dollars\". \"Shelling out\" came to mean paying in coins or bills, and eventually by check or credit card. Little did we know that we had touched the very origins of our species.\" Again, this serves to highlight the idea that the language of money takes us back to well before recorded history, right to the very roots of homo sapiens sapiens , the wise ape capable of complex communication and its concomitant: the calculation of value. This practice therefore extends far back beyond Native American uses and includes examples from Spain to the Great Rift Valley in Kenya to even older sites further South: \"Recently regular shells, prepared as strung beads and dating to 75,000 BP, have been found in Blombos Cave in South Africa [...] The work is highly skilled, indicating a practice that probably dates much further back in time. The origin of collecting and decorating is quite likely African, the original homeland of the anatomically modern subspecies. Collecting and making necklaces must have had an important selection benefit, since it was costly \u2013 manufacture of these shells took a great deal of both skill and time during an era when humans lived constantly on the brink of starvation.\" Reciprocal altruism These strings of regular shells and other items can also have been used to satisfy our aesthetic tastes - made for sheer enjoyment. Far from an explanation, this raises a problem for evolutionary psychologists: why do people find the collection and wearing of jewelry enjoyable? What caused this pleasure to evolve? This takes us into a section about John Maynard Smith, evolutionary psychology, population genetics, selfish genes and Nash Equilibria. The critical question in all the theory is: how did cooperative strategies evolve? \"The situations where such cooperation in fact occurs in the animal world are highly constrained [...] The most common case is when parasites, and hosts whose bodies they share, evolve into symbiotes [...] However, there is much more than cooperation going on here \u2013 there is also exploitation. They occur simultaneously. The situation is analogous to an institution humans would develop \u2013 tribute [...] Some very special instances occur that do not involve parasite and host sharing the same body and evolving into symbiotes. Rather, they involve non-kin animals and highly constrained territory. A prominent example Dawkins describes are cleaner fish [...] The entrance costs, and thus the exit costs, of the relationship are high, so that it works out without cheating.\" After discussing vampire bats who regurgitate blood, most often to kin but sometimes to non-kin (the go-to example for evolutionary psychologists interested in reciprocal altruism), Szabo pulls a quote from Richard Dawkins which defines the rest of his essay: \"We will see that some humans, too, chose highly risky and discontinuous prey items, and shared the resulting surpluses with non-kin. Indeed, they accomplished this to a far greater extent than the vampire bat [...] Dawkins suggests, \"money is a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism\" , but then pursues this fascinating idea no further. We will.\" We've established through Antonopoulos that money is a language for communicating value, and that it was used long before writing was developed. This is now pushing to the heart of why language itself is useful at the biological, genetic level of our evolution: it fosters cooperation. In more technical terms, it allows us to overcome the value measurement problem - i.e. if you scratch my back in return for a piece of fruit, how long must you scratch for; how many ticks should you find; how big must the piece of fruit be; how do we remember who owes what in the case of delayed reciprocity? The cognitive overhead implied by this problem has never been overcome, except by homo sapiens sapiens. \"If clams can be money, furs can be money, gold can be money, and so on \u2013 if money is not just coins or notes issued by a government under legal tender laws, but rather can be a wide variety of objects \u2013 then just what is money anyway?\" This should be a question that you're becoming increasingly familiar with. Szabo goes on to quote Carl Menger's theory that money arises from a sufficient volume of commodity barter and discusses the issues with barter that could've lead to its further development as an abstraction. Contrast this with the David Graeber brief, up next, to get a sense for the different approaches to this question. We tend to side with Graeber, but don't take our word for it! In any case, Szabo makes a profound and underappreciated point in discussing the problem of scale which arises with barter: \"With money, there are only n prices \u2013 500 products, 500 prices. Money for this purpose can work either as a medium of exchange or simply as a standard of value \u2013 as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large to memorize or change too often.\" Money has a price! There are, in fact, different prices for different kinds of money. This is why we have included the Perry Mehrling lectures in this section. Though it's not expected you watch them all, the ones we have selected will give you much deeper insight into this simple, though surprising, fact. Szabo goes on to define early forms of money like the wampum shells described above as \"collectibles\" and uses this to illustrate why \"people, clans or tribes trade voluntarily: because both sides believe they gain something.\" Trade benefits from lowered transaction costs, which are exactly where collectibles serve usefully, apart from their aesthetic or sentimental value. He describes: \"how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer \u2013 in the voluntary free gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary transfers of legal judgments and tribute [...] Durable collectibles, what today we would call heirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer \u2013 often making the transfer even possible at all.\" We'll be exploring this idea later in the course through the context of gifts, which we feel provide another, perhaps more profound, level of understanding to these types of transactions, but Szabo's argument about lowered transaction costs is nevertheless well worth reflecting on. He goes on to provide a most fascinating example: the Kula trading network of pre-colonial Melanesia. Most interestingly, in the context of money as a language: \"The Kula valuables doubled as \"high power\" money and mnemonic for stories and gossip . Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in kind. Kula collectibles solved this double-coincidence problem as an unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!) money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a very regular pattern.\" Mnemonics In analyzing such wealth transfers, we need to keep two things in mind: context (the time it occurs at and the supply/demand at that moment) as well as what Szabo calls the \"flow graph of monetary circulation\" which allows collectibles to accrue value over time. For example, food is worth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones. However, the trust required to make the requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so collectibles substituted for otherwise necessary but non-existent long term trust relationships. In tandem with this kind of \"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a theory of trade-based predation - pointing out that many paleolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated seasonally, i.e. Reindeer or Bison. Importantly: \"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that single beneficial trades were possible. We must identify closed loops of mutually beneficial trades. With closed loops the collectibles continue to circulate, amortizing their costs.\" We're now deep down the evolutionary rabbit hole, and there's yet more ground to cover, because collectibles are not only useful for starvation insurance: they can be used to trade abstract foraging rights, as is still the case with !Kung in Southern Africa today. Nevertheless the major point remains that underneath our great economic institutions are far more ancient institutions that also involved wealth transfer . Most importantly, this kind of transfer can be passed between generations : i.e. kin altruism beyond the grave. \"The demand for a durable and general store of wealth for use in marriage, inheritance, dispute resolution, and tribute was thus even more urgent than for trade itself. Furthermore, these institutions may predate inter-tribal trade, and involved for most tribes a greater transfer of wealth than trade. These institutions thus more than trade served as the motivator and incubator of the earliest primitive money.\" It should be becoming obvious that communicating value and transferring it are one and the same thing; it's just that media which are not perfect abstractions - which have their own, intrinsic value - obfuscate this essential fact. \"Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.\" This has always been true, and in an even deeper sense that Szabo is getting at here. Wealth is itself a mnemonic, perfectly illustrated by the fact that you now need only remember a 12 word mnemonic, which you can carry in your mind across any border in the world, in order to have immediate access to wealth. Then follows a few paragraphs about gifts and gift exchange. It's well worth reading for yourself, but we will cover this concept as its own section in Week 8. Szabo also discusses other forms of wealth transfer: family trade and marriage - putting particular emphasis on this notion of the closed loop of circulating collectibles - as well as tribute and the spoils of war. Again, when paying tribute: \"Collectibles doubled as a primitive mnemonic device that, while not verbatim, could be used as an aid to recall the terms of the treaty.\" It's crucial that you see and understand the link between money, language, mnemonics, and memory (both individual and collective). It sits at the very heart of why innovating the technology of money is so meaningful. Another critical point that comes up in the section on Spoils of War is that tribes would often hide wealth in order to reduce the tribute they were forced to pay. This remains true today, albeit it in a more complex way. There is a very good reason we use the words \"shell corporation\". The innovation of a public, auditable, verifiable ledger changes this fundamentally, with hard-to-predict effects. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on the two points above. Taxes and coins Szabo uses these sneaky tribal tactics as a segue into the work of Arthur Laffer, who proved that as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate, due to increased avoidance, evasion, and - most of all - disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. This has become known as the Laffer Curve: \"On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Charles Adams uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives \u2013 both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments \u2013 to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\" We then move from collectibles to coins. Specifically, this was begun by a Greek-speaking culture in Anatolia (modern Turkey): the Lydians, whose kings were the first major issuers of coins. The main question about coins is why minting was dominated by governments as opposed to private interests - and the answer is not just the government's ability to enforce anti-counterfeit measures more effectively. It has to do with the fact that coins are high velocity money, facilitating a large number of low value trades. \"The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure to value of wealth held and exchanged by his subjects more accurately. That the exchange also benefited from cheaper measurement by traders of the medium of exchange, creating something closer to efficient markets, and allowing individuals to enter into the marketplace on a larger scale for the first time, was for the king a fortuitous side effect.\" Being from the internet, we reject kings, presidents and voting; opting rather for rough consensus and running code. The question is whether we can have efficient marketplaces without central authorities such that the fortuitous side effects of global trade can accrue to the people actually trading, rather than the authorities \"allowing\" that trade to occur. Resolution Human relationships of any kind generally require some kind of dispute resolution mechanisms in order to be sustainable in the long term. Szabo tackles this thorny issue next: \"Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment.\" There is a lot more to be said about dispute resolution, but we selected this particular quote because it highlights a fundamentally important idea for Web 3: anybody keen to advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record? Because it's the perfect tool to do so. We can use economics to combat economic evils like the privatization of prisons. It may seem far-fetched, but these are the kind of society-level changes we want you to think about, because they are, in principle, possible. This takes us back to the primary importance of understanding this notion of collectibles: \"Indeed, collectibles provided a fundamental improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism , allowing humans to cooperate in ways unavailable to other species. For them, reciprocal altruism is severely limited by unreliable memory. Some other species have large brains, build their own homes, or make and use tools. No other species has produced such an improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism. The evidence indicates this new development had matured by 40,000 B.P.\" Szabo goes on to discuss the properties of such collectibles and give multiple examples of their development through history, basically linking up everything above. Importantly, he makes the point in the context of all this history, that \"A novelty of the 20 th century was the issue of fiat currencies by governments. While generally excellent as a media of exchange, fiat currencies have proven to be very poor stores of value [due mainly to inflation].\" It's fascinating to consider the money we use today as a novelty, rather than a given. In any case, we then arrive at the conclusion: Collectibles were crucial in lowering transaction costs such that our ancestors could trade between tribes and not just with kin, without succumbing to either the value measurement problem or the prisoner's dilemma. Collectibles entirely replaced reputation as the enforcer of reciprocation, although violence still played a major role in enforcing rights as well as being a high transaction cost that prevented most kinds of trade. To be useful as a general-purpose store of wealth and means of wealth transfer, a collectible had to have certain functional properties and be embedded in at least one institution with a closed-loop cycle, so that the cost of discovering and/or manufacturing the object was amortized over multiple transactions. With its unprecedented technology of cooperation, humans have become the most fearsome predator ever seen on the planet.","title":"Shells"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#recollecting-our-origins","text":"Shelling Out Read It This Nick Szabo article, originally published in 2002, has been selected because it provides a detailed historical backdrop which we will both challenge and build upon in the curated materials that follow.","title":"\ud83d\udd30 Recollecting Our Origins"},{"location":"module-2/shelling-out/#how-does-this-fit-into-kernel","text":"This has been chosen for KERNEL, in particular, because it speaks directly to: Reciprocal altruism and the problem of cooperation.

They solved this by adopting the form of money used by the majority of Native Americans: wampum (or clam) shells. This strategy was so successful, and trade in wampum so widely accepted, that wampum became legal tender in New England from 1637 to 1661.

Please enjoy.","title":"Week 3"},{"location":"module-3/freedom/","text":"Freedom Before reading through this note, ask a few people you respect to define \"freedom\" and say what it means to them. Like most fundamental concepts we've covered so far - trust, value, meaning, money and speech - the answers to this basic inquiry are often shallow or insufficient. Freedom is only the ability to be conscious of the constraints within which you operate. This definition via complementary opposites should be familiar by now. Buddhists call it \"the freedom of no escape\". There is nowhere to be but here. Truly accepting this fact and submitting to reality as it is, rather than how you wish it to be, is the beginning of liberation. The struggle in our day and age is not collective; it is individual. This is not to say there are no collective issues worth fighting for: basic needs (land, shelter, water, food, and sanitation), equal opportunity, and just institutions are all necessary. As Graeber showed : this is the same revolutionary program from antiquity: \"Forgive debt and redistribute the land.\" What is required - in addition to this - is \" every single soul taking every single step \" so that we can figure out together how to create what was old community in future form. Freedom will not be found in some idealized future where we all enjoy sovereignty, universal suffrage, basic income, and any other transient goal cooked up by the current zeitgeist. Again, these projects are necessary - they build human capacity and ability - but they will not set us free. Freedom is the simple combination of awareness and acceptance. It is here and now, or not at all. We are limited, flawed beings: there is no escaping this simple fact of experience. It is not by denying one's boundaries, but by embracing them, that real liberation can become a daily experience, rather than a concept to be realized once some external project has come to fruition. Application How does this apply to trust and value? Well, value is generated from trust in clearly shared truths , and modern trust is an emergent property of protocols that define and encode what it means to cheat so that it may be prevented without human interpretation or enforcement. Freedom is our conscious ability to decide which shared truths to trust based on how well defined and encoded the concept of \"cheating\" is that created those truths. Meaning, we have the freedom to define what boundaries we choose. It is not possible, though, to operate efficiently with no boundaries at all. Which is why the practice of freedom includes an acceptance that it is not possible to exist without limitation. Lived freedom is the conscious navigation of trade-offs. This is a critical point: the products we create should not aim to make people \"more free\" - that way lies false marketing campaigns and disappointment. Our products should be conscious of, and communicate clearly, how they constrain the people who use them. In doing so, they create the environment for people to become aware of the trade-offs they themselves are making, which is the only kind of freedom we can trust to generate sustainable value.","title":"Freedom"},{"location":"module-3/freedom/#freedom","text":"Before reading through this note, ask a few people you respect to define \"freedom\" and say what it means to them.

Who do you want to take it back from? Why do you want to take it back? What will you do with it once it's been handed over to your care? More seriously, we are conditioned to value action and results over intention. We live in a global culture that emphasizes what we achieve rather than what we mean. Actions are, in a sense, how we attempt to make the external world match our internal world. They're important, and what you achieve matters, but it is not the primary matter. If you are not clear about your internal world - about what you mean to do - you will never be satisfied with the external world. Unless you examine your own expectations, you will always be disappointed. How can you hope to improve the world if you do not know how to improve yourself? Our action-oriented culture, driven by results, encourages us to believe that life is about what we can expect of the world. However, the reality is that an honest, reflective life is about responding truly, in every moment, to what the world expects of you. This is only possible if you constantly practice awareness of your intentions. This primary focus on intention and expectation is inspired by Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning , but you can find some version of it across nearly all the world's major wisdom traditions.

How does this fit into KERNEL? This week's curated materials have all tried to identify and draw out a particular stream of thought that predates the internet. This is because the internet is just the latest in a long line of attempts to collect and make navigable the sum total of human knowledge. Access to this shared record and the means to move through it meaningfully confer great power. We have a unique opportunity as a generation to ensure both record and means remain open to all. In particular, this video will help you understand more about The technical history of the web, it's different phases, and where it might be headed next. Why adding trust to the read/write web is such an important development. Verifiability, open services, and market protocols as some examples of the new primitives we can use to build different incentive structures into Web 3. Smart contracts as the basis for permanent and stable digital jurisdictions. Brief Introduction Web 3 is a part of a larger phase transition in our internet (and our society). We're going from a pre-computing to a post-computing civilization. This is happening at break-neck speed in terms of the evolutionary history of our species, though it simultaneously feels slow to us as individuals now used to communicating at light-speed with anyone, anywhere. Think of it in terms of periodic waves: mainframes, computers, GUIs, the internet, the web, web 2.0, mobile, blockchains, web 3. Can you imagine where we'll be in 40 years? Exact developments in this sort of timeframe are extremely difficult to predict, though... \"The choices that we make in the technologies we build - the properties we give our products - will have drastic implications not just for ourselves, but for many people in the future.\" Juan then details the key questions which define and constrain the superpowers bestowed by each new wave: How they work How reliable and correct they are How open and accessible they are How safe they are How they fail Who controls them and how they're governed What rights they secure/guarantee/grant people \"We must be very careful about the things we build. We should care about maximizing human potential; promoting rights; and the long-term flourishing of humanity when thinking about the technologies we create.\" History There is a difference between \"the internet\": the wires and networking protocols which evolved mostly from military and academic work from the 1960's and 70's onward; and \"the web\": hyperlinked documents, static pages and browsers etc. Web 1.0 ( 1991 to 2000) Mostly static, read-only content. This also marks the beginning of \"online\" commercial activity. Web 2.0 (the early 2000's). It's key characteristic is its dynamic, interactive nature as opposed to the largely static content of the 90's. It's often described as \"the read-write web\" and is more participatory, social, and market-based - think not only Facebook and Twitter, but Uber, AirBnB etc. The advertising model in Web 2.0 is broken. It optimizes for time spent on pages and tries to keep people and their data locked in. Anger is a great way to generate clicks, so we're increasingly optimizing for negative emotions in order to pay the bills. Web 3.0 (now) This next iteration of the web gives us read, write and trust . Web 1.0 was about linking content together. Web 2.0 was about linking programs to that content and building rich, dynamic applications which work across our devices. Web 3.0 is about linking content and programs directly to each other, removing intermediaries and gaining public verifiability. Web 3.0 is turning centralized applications into decentralized protocols. The path forward The aim for us should be to take what Bitcoin did to money and do it to all kinds of services and applications. Bitcoin \"thawed the peer-to-peer winter and reminded everyone that we can build these kinds of systems and succeed.\" Now, it's time to hook into the larger movement happening across the internet to change how the web itself works: how we store, retrieve and consult the shared record of human knowledge. The simple property of verifiability is the key to all this. The \"ability to check\" is as powerful as the ability to hyperlink text in your documents was in Web 1.0. It's a new kind of linguistic primitive. Most people do not understand this, similar to how hyperlinks were misunderstood early in protocol development. Free thought It is not just blockchains. It's \"the decentralized web\" in general. Blockchains systematize economics and law, and did not actually start in the web - Bitcoin was a protocol built to run separately without needing a browser. So a big part of Web 3 work is to make these things actually talk to each other: to make blockchains accessible to people . This goes to the heart of safer, more resilient, and more ethical protocols which can literally encode social contracts in ways which are visible and meaningful to the people using them. Open services and market protocols are what we're really able to build in Web 3.0. The old economic truths which sunk open source p2p software in the past are no longer true. We can now create commodities out of things that were fixed resources: i.e. storage, computation, and bandwidth. This will allow p2p to compete with centralized alternatives. Smart contract systems are the basis of jurisdictions. They are computable law. We won't tap the potential of this for many years to come. So, if you want to bake rights into your systems and \"lock the web open\" as many of us do, then think about what it means to encode rules into the jurisdiction of the internet, because that's what is really happening here. In a way, the internet is becoming a nation. See J. P. Barlow's \" Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace \". The other web 3 The linked data, semantic web actually coined the term \"Web 3\" back in 2004. This idea was started by Tim Berners-Lee , and is aimed at making everything interoperable, removing intermediaries and decentralizing the control of information. His approach has been to model ontologies and data so as to connect computers on the machine-readable web. The most successful Linked Data work ended up powering the Knowledge Graph and the Facebook Open Graph, which is a far cry from the decentralized vision which started it all. Much like the work on transformative tools for thought, this is due to issues around funding public goods which - if nothing else - blockchains can genuinely help solve. The decentralized web movement, the blockchain movement, and the linked data movement are all part of Web 3. We're in it to build a permanent, ownerless, and borderless foundation for this connected global community of which we are all a part.","title":"Lock It Open"},{"location":"module-3/lock-it-open/#lock-the-web-open","text":"\"Web 3.0 is an executable Magna Carta - the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot.\" - Gavin Wood In this video, Juan Benet shows how \"Web 3\" relates to a larger movement happening across the internet right now, aimed at re-imagining how we share and relate.

Open services and market protocols are what we're really able to build in Web 3.0. The old economic truths which sunk open source p2p software in the past are no longer true. We can now create commodities out of things that were fixed resources: i.e. storage, computation, and bandwidth. This will allow p2p to compete with centralized alternatives. Smart contract systems are the basis of jurisdictions. They are computable law. We won't tap the potential of this for many years to come. So, if you want to bake rights into your systems and \"lock the web open\" as many of us do, then think about what it means to encode rules into the jurisdiction of the internet, because that's what is really happening here. In a way, the internet is becoming a nation. See J. P.

The most successful Linked Data work ended up powering the Knowledge Graph and the Facebook Open Graph, which is a far cry from the decentralized vision which started it all.

To establish our first pillar, we'll mix a Vannevar Bush essay from 1945 and a 2019 essay from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen: As We May Think Think Transformative Tools for Thought Again How does this fit into KERNEL? We must be clear on what \"taking back the web\" means. The internet came with grand dreams, though we're mostly stuck with artificial social spaces, overwhelming algorithms, and extractive incentives which are mining our attention as a means of propping up a failing economy. These two essays draw out a common thread of thought stretched across 74 years in order to illustrate what sorts of freedom are actually on offer in this world wide web of ours. Since 1945, one critical feature has revolved around constructing new media for free and creative thought. At first it may seem unrelated to blockchains, but tools for thought are public goods and suffer from the same problem of incentives as all other public goods. They are thus the perfect example of paradigm shifts which require us to understand why programming regenerative incentives matters, and what economic code can really be used to achieve in the long-term. \"The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.\" Brief We'll be taking great liberties by summarizing both of these essays extensively, so we recommend you take the time to read them in full. There is no substitution for knowing your roots, or seeing how the branches grow today. Bush is writing as Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development at the end of WWII. His aim is to interrogate what all the scientists will do once the war is over. He urges scientists to take on the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. This is about a new relationship between thinking humans and the sum of what we know. He begins with an idea we will return to with Juan Benet: cooperation . \"The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership [...] They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.\" Free yourself to work together Pointing out that science has given us increased control over our environment, improved how we meet our basic needs, boosted health (mental and physical), extended lifespans, provided swift communications and allowed us to create a record of ideas that endures beyond any one individual life, Bush comes to the central problem we still face today: \"There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial [...] \"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record .\" This is Bush's central theme, and it is timeless. We discussed how the record we use for establishing our shared history and for recording our transactions became one and the same thing in 2009, but we have yet to attend to this central question: how can we best use it ? The technology of the 1940's was very different, and Bush spends much time discussing the rise of complex machinery with interchangeable parts which could serve reliably, then the advances in photography and facsimile transmission, followed by the advances in voice recording. He uses these to imagine a world where scientists walk around with a camera on their head, recording their observations (both verbal and visual) and storing these on microfilm , which is the core technology he uses to spool out the rest of his ideas. We're summarizing extensively, but here are the critical points he makes in Sections 2 and 3. \"A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended , it must be stored , and above all it must be consulted .\" \"[Using microfilm] the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk [...] Compression is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it [...] Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm Britannica would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent.\" Section 4 is about mechanization of the repetitive processes of thought which, to Bush, includes advanced analysis because creative thinking is concerned only with the selection of data and the process to be employed. The manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence can be relegated to machines. Our technology must allow users \"to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules [...] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate figures [...] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed.\" Section 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives into the final and most critical part the human record: consultation . Selecting the trail \"We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This [...] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection , and here we are halting indeed [...] Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. \"[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [...] operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\" Bush introduces the \"memex\" - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording technologies, and associative selection. It won't be as fast or flexibile as the brain, but it could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall. \"This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.\" Bush is really talking about building \"user trails\" through these associative indices. In much the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails could also be shared: my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two. \"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [...] There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.\" Bush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human nervous system. He ends with this: \"[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.\" The mnemonic medium Media for thought are all around us: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. Media for thought create powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly impossible. Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further. \ud83d\udca1 If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free. \"Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: 'the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization' [...] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning.\" Leveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to remember what you've read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this context, it means adopting highly specialized flash cards in an essay, and spaced repetition (SRM) reminders after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer. Matuschak and Nielsen discuss many preliminary results and argue that though this may seem like \"just\" an essay with fancy flashcards, simple media can still be profound in their unexpected implications. Just look at writing. Or money. Why all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic. \"Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge [...] because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative . That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up.\" The key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a scalable memory laboratory which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning. \"We\u2019ll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [...] Seriously developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought.\" Network structures for knowledge Critically, memory systems need to ensure that people don't just learn surface features; they need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as carrying two texts: the actual one and the reflected one, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards. However, it is a mistake to think \"good memory system == spaced repetition\". There is also elaborative encoding and the sort of associative trails Bush was talking about; and techniques like the method of loci , though this isn't as useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge (esp. for novices). Seeing this broader perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like: \ud83d\udca1 What is the ideal network structure of knowledge? And what does memory have to do with understanding and creativity ? Conceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely automating away the problem of memory, the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get through. The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of chunking , as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970's. \"Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 patterns of chess pieces. These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players perceive as a unity, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces [...] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition.\" Of course, we still need to know what to memorize and what the impact of such media will really be on people's cognition and behaviour. My sense is that having transportable user trails , like Bush imagined in '45, would be extremely useful. How to make these easily shareable? Just encode them as 12-word mnemonics inside a world computer ... Designing insight Nielsen and Matuschak then discuss what it would have taken to get from Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numeral from a design perspective. \"The design and mathematical insights are inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa [... This is] a general truth: the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter [... Mnemonic media] will express deep original insights into memory [...] A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.\" This general truth reveals the deep difference between what Alan Kay called \"pop\" and \"research\" cultures. Pop culture is great at producing products we consume, but is insufficient for creating new tools for thought. \"The warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought [...] The aspiration is [...] to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of the modern research culture.\" \"This is not the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. New tools can lead to new subject matter insights for humanity as a whole , and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.\" \"Doing this is a cultural struggle. It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the insight-through-making loop working at full throttle [...] You have brilliant researchers who think of making as something essentially trivial, 'just a matter of implementation'. And you have makers who don\u2019t understand research, who see it as merely a slow and dysfunctional process.\" Extending our mnemonics The second half of the essay explores tools for thought more generally, starting with two videos well worth experiencing yourself. \"Watching this video is a remarkable emotional experience. It\u2019s obvious the person narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but empathize [...] It\u2019s tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it\u2019s the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action [...] \"Is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video \u2013 a range which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? [...] To create an integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience?\" We must take emotion as seriously as movie, music, and video game designers do. All of these people have elaborate models for emotional response, which we must also take into account if we are to augment our freedom to think with digital tools. Tools for thought are public goods. Thus they suffer from the same issues around funding and building the right kind of practices and processes required for real development. \"Consider our most fundamental tools for thought \u2013 language, writing, music, etc. Those are public goods [...] These tools all introduce fundamental new mental representations and operations. Those aren\u2019t owned by any company, they\u2019re patterns owned by humanity .\" \"We need to develop a powerful praxis, a set of core ideas which are explicit and powerful enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice.\" Why is it worthwhile devoting yourself to an open-ended endeavour like this which isn't as well-funded as many other sectors in tech? Well, because: \"The creation of language \u2013 the ur tool for thought \u2013 is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity\u2019s existence [...] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought \u2013 writing, the printing press, and so on \u2013 are among our greatest ever breakthroughs.\" What will new tools for thought really look like? Our contention is that protocols for money are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool. \"If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person\u2019s thinking, or even their consciousness .\" Executable books Let's go one step further, by considering an economic argument about what factors actually effect long-term wealth inequality (turns out it's not initial distribution, but the nature of transactions). Because this surprising result is arrived at computationally in an open-source Jupyter notebook, you can test it yourself, and are invited to find initial distributions which do effect long-term inequalities if you can. The authors call this \"Scaffolded exploration: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge. It\u2019s tempting to regard [Jupyter notebooks] as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they\u2019re a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further. \"There\u2019s a general principle here: good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems [...] Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers. They\u2019re not working on the problem for a paycheck; they\u2019re working on it because they desperately want to know the answer.\" The ultimate aspiration here is to develop canonical media in these new tools, like 2001: A Space Odyssey created for movies. Nielsen and Matuschak suggest that: \"One fun project would be to develop an executable form of the most recent IPCC climate assessment report. Instead of a report full of assertions and references, you\u2019d have a live climate model for people to explore. If it was good enough, people would teach classes from it; if it was really superb, not only would they teach classes from it, it could perhaps become the creative working environment for many climate scientists.\" The best example of this currently is The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics: \"Many theorems aren\u2019t just expressed in static form, on the page, but live, as code which can be modified by the user. Theorems become APIs, which can literally be applied to other objects, and chained together. It uses a much more powerful underlying model than Jupyter, developing a new symbolic language as part of the book.\" Emotional ends \"It\u2019s striking to contrast conventional technical books with the possibilities enabled by executable books. You can imagine starting an executable book with, say, quantum teleportation, right on the first page. You\u2019d provide an interface \u2013 perhaps a library is imported \u2013 that would let users teleport quantum systems immediately [...] \"You could begin an executable book with material the users already care about, can connect to easily, and find motivating [...] but such an opening won\u2019t suffer the drawback of popular science, of being vague and imprecise. Rather, the interface would be completely well specified and could be scaled out, applied in ever-expanding contexts. The understanding would be transferable. Even a user who has understood only a tiny part of the material could begin tinkering, building up an understanding based on play and exploration .\" This is the first part of what it really means to \"take back the web\". It's about building public tools for thought which - like language - are really patterns owned by humanity as a whole, in which we can playfully explore with each other the very edges of our shared record of knowledge, adding new pieces as scaffolding for those who follow to continue the fun.

It\u2019s obvious the person narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but empathize [...] It\u2019s tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it\u2019s the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action [...] \"Is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video \u2013 a range which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? [...] To create an integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience?\" We must take emotion as seriously as movie, music, and video game designers do. All of these people have elaborate models for emotional response, which we must also take into account if we are to augment our freedom to think with digital tools. Tools for thought are public goods. Thus they suffer from the same issues around funding and building the right kind of practices and processes required for real development. \"Consider our most fundamental tools for thought \u2013 language, writing, music, etc. Those are public goods [...] These tools all introduce fundamental new mental representations and operations. Those aren\u2019t owned by any company, they\u2019re patterns owned by humanity .\" \"We need to develop a powerful praxis, a set of core ideas which are explicit and powerful enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice.\" Why is it worthwhile devoting yourself to an open-ended endeavour like this which isn't as well-funded as many other sectors in tech? Well, because: \"The creation of language \u2013 the ur tool for thought \u2013 is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity\u2019s existence [...] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought \u2013 writing, the printing press, and so on \u2013 are among our greatest ever breakthroughs.\" What will new tools for thought really look like? Our contention is that protocols for money are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool. \"If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person\u2019s thinking, or even their consciousness .\"","title":"Extending our mnemonics"},{"location":"module-3/remember/#executable-books","text":"Let's go one step further, by considering an economic argument about what factors actually effect long-term wealth inequality (turns out it's not initial distribution, but the nature of transactions).

The authors call this \"Scaffolded exploration: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge. It\u2019s tempting to regard [Jupyter notebooks] as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they\u2019re a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further. \"There\u2019s a general principle here: good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems [...] Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers. They\u2019re not working on the problem for a paycheck; they\u2019re working on it because they desperately want to know the answer.\" The ultimate aspiration here is to develop canonical media in these new tools, like 2001: A Space Odyssey created for movies. Nielsen and Matuschak suggest that: \"One fun project would be to develop an executable form of the most recent IPCC climate assessment report. Instead of a report full of assertions and references, you\u2019d have a live climate model for people to explore. If it was good enough, people would teach classes from it; if it was really superb, not only would they teach classes from it, it could perhaps become the creative working environment for many climate scientists.\" The best example of this currently is The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics: \"Many theorems aren\u2019t just expressed in static form, on the page, but live, as code which can be modified by the user.

There's no-one better than Douglas Rushkoff to present the second part of this for us: creating time. The presentation is summarized extensively below for those who apparently \"don't have the time\", and Rushkoff will show you how this attitude is a shortsighted way to live life which reveals basically everything wrong with the way we currently use the internet. Brief \"Slackers were a people of the early and mid-1980's who wanted to create more time to have fun and read and think [...] The net looked like this great way to create time . We were all gonna get to work at home, in our underwear, in our own time, and exchange and transact directly in some kind of an Etsy, Burning Man-like rave of culture and intellect. But something else happened on the way home from Wired magazine, which is that the internet instead became the poster child for the dying Nasdaq stock exchange and, as I see it, the dying industrial age economy. So, instead of using the net to create more time for people, we turned human attention into the next commodity.\" In the extractive perspective of corporate capitalism, human attention is an untapped resource. We were only spending 8 hours a day working and 2 hours consuming, so why not encourage us to spend 48-hours a day working, consuming, and socializing? This is possible if we break up our attention into four parallel tracks - all in the pursuit of \" mining time \". \"Instead of getting an internet which gave us more time to think; instead of getting an internet that worked not like a phone, but a properly asynchronous technology that would sit and wait until we were ready to deal with it; instead of having sequential conferences on bulletin boards like The Well where you would take hours to craft a response to something, we ended up with a digital space where we were constantly being interrupted [...] We end up in this state of constant emergency interruption which I don't think is healthy neurologically or culturally.\" What Rushkoff is exploring is whether the digital media environment is genuinely asynchronous. Here is the ultimate argument for \"bad blockchain UX\" . Maybe this is really our opportunity to build properly asynchronous experiences and train people to work and create in their own time , rather than something to be papered over as best we can with solutions that compromise the inherent properties of the protocols on which they build? \"Are we moving into a political landscape where we no longer have 'ends-justify-the-means', goal-orientated, future-based campaigns, but rather some kind of a presentist, process-orientated, consensus-building politic; more embodied by something like Occupy than it is by a two-party ideological debate?\" This was said in 2013, and has turned out not to be true. Yet. It is still a powerful question, the answer to which depends on whether you think the current political climate is a trend, or a temporary reaction against the trend. \"Finally, are the folks who should be helping us think about this instead just taking a very 20 th -Century, almost Biblical, template and superimposing it on this presentist world we're living in? In other words, are they so intolerant of a world that doesn't have a defined conclusion; which doesn't have a goal; in which we're not leading towards some climax, that they overlay this bizarre notion of a singularity?\" Rushkoff went on to extend these ideas in Team Human , which is another fantastic read for any budding media theorist. His voice is a critical counterpoint to SV singularity worship. \"The book is a humanist work, and I'm declaring myself with Jaron Lanier and other humanists. I do believe there is something special about people that we don't quite understand and that our efforts to upload ourselves or simulate our realities will fall short of what it actually is to be human. Our best defense against present shock is to be in the genuine present .\" This is a spiritual statement, and it may seem that the ultimate end of both Rushkoff's work and \" The Age of Spiritual Machines \" and all the 'bizarre singularity stuff' is one and the same. However, there is a critical difference: Rushkoff is saying we, us messy human beings, have to find our own way into the genuine present. Kurzweil is saying that the machines will do it for us. Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle? Conspiring against the actual OS \"It does require still being together , looking another person in the eye, learning how to breathe together. Conspire : literally, 'breathe together'. It requires us to see how human environments empower us against abstract entities which depend on our isolation and alienation [...] This local, body-based sensibility is the thing which can bring us to understand the kinds of time that can't be measure on a clock or a calendar or a computer. The underlying human rhythms.\" This is followed by a question about where exactly between Kurzweil and Lanier we can locate Rushkoff's ideas, to which he replies: \"I love digital technology, I just think we're misapplying it when we use it to amplify the obsolete agenda of a 13 th Century economic operating system. There was an emerging, peer-to-peer economic landscape in the 11 th and 12 th Centuries in Europe, through which people were developing local currencies and trading in local bazaars, and we had the rise of a middle class like we've never seen in history.\" The feudal lords were not included in this wealth creation, so they made it illegal through charter monopolies. Therefore, instead of creating, we had to get jobs. Instead of being paid for what we made, we got paid for the time we worked. It was a temporal shift . The invention of the clock and a specific kind of sovereign currency are co-incidental, not coincidence. This works as long as the economy expands, because more money must be paid back than is lent out - a feature which led to the perverse growth mindset we still suffer from today. Critically, new kinds of economic systems, if engineered well, could free us from industrial-age clocks and allow us to adopt a different kind of temporal landscape, which means a different kind of money and transaction that is \"much more real-time based, rather than being biased to storage and saving over time, or both .\" We know from Andreas that engineering both is an actual possibility currently underway. \"We could have transactions that are earned into existence.\" It's bold because it's important. Peer-to-peer, electronic payment systems are not about debt vs ownership. They are about earnings based on time vs earnings based on creativity. \ud83d\udca1 Take a moment to reflect on this statement. \"The problem with technologists who disrupt any given industry is that, once they've done that, they go back to Goldman and ask for a Series B. They're not willing to undermine the operating system that they're sitting on top of [...] What I want them to do is break that OS, or challenge it, or come up with an alternative. Why do you need to go back to corporate capital and put the clock back into businesses that weren't on it!?\" This moves into a discussion about old industries being disrupted by networked services which didn't even intend to do so. Rushkoff argues that many internet-age services - like Pandora - are locally disruptive, but then turn to the NYSE to get funded and so fail to challenge the real paradigm they ought to be disrupting. Media Environments \"I don't mean peer-to-peer sharing of Sony music. I mean peer-to-peer sharing of music that we make . This would create a different kind of social marketplace that would allow music - not to get New Age - to retrieve some of its sacred value as opposed to its monetary value. And why is it OK that it retrieves some sacred value? Because it turns out that we don't really need everybody making money, because we don't really need to get to full employment, because we don't all really need jobs, because we have more than enough stuff already.\" This is also critical: jobs are not the problem . I don't want a job - I want my basic needs fulfilled and a degree of comfort and security which will enable me to make a meaningful contribution. Jobs are an artifact of the industrial age and a certain way of existing in time. \"What I am looking at in Present Shock is what McLuhan called the difference in media environments created by different technologies. The invention of text is what put us in time to begin with. With text, we got accountability [...] With text we got a religion that was based on accountability: it was a covenant, a contract with God [...] We get moschiach , we get messiah, we get the calendar, we get the past and future, we get laws, we get sabbath. With the clock, we get the industrial age, we get efficiency [...] we get interest-based currency and the idea of trying to do more in less. We get a time-is-money, efficiency-based culture.\" Time is not money. Time is time, and making money into an open protocol that anyone can access gives us the opportunity to free value from its dependence on transient expression. Rushkoff describes the move from a sweeping second hand to a digital clock, with the effect it had on our media environment. It replaced story cycles with sequential movement. In a world of remote controls and DVRs and asynchronous behaviour, the great narrative arcs which have held culture together until now no longer function. \"We don't care if Homer gets out the power plant before it blows up; we care about what scene is being satired, what connections we can make, how this is going meta on that and then meta on this and so on [...] It's a very different, presentist approach to problems where we move through media much more like a video game: in real-time, first-person, choice to choice.\" The conversation moves into a description of \"presentist\" narratives and the further breaking down of this single crisis-climax-sleep, hero's journey arc typical of Western culture into something more like a role-playing video game, where we \"Uncover reality, rather than move through a singular narrative [...] It ends up much more fractal! It turns out we don't have to have an end to reality.\" Questions? At 43 minutes, we move into the Q A section. The first question asks if this is a novel problem because, for instance, Buddhism can be seen as a system for dealing with present shock and pulling you deeply into the now. To which Rushkoff answers: \"The problem has been around forever, but the form of distraction from the present changes.\" He describes chronos (clock time) and kairos (human time, timing). Each invention - text, the clock, digital technology - takes us out of kairos and into chronos and, in each case, the answer is the same: to fall back into the present and to be here now . But the trick to being here now in an industrial era is different than the trick to being here now in a digital era. The second question is about using technology to enhance creativity. \"We all know two kids with a laptop can create an application that changes the world. The problem is: how do you help them see that the first thing to do after they get some success and traction is not to sell it to people who will use it against it's original purposes [...] That is: it's OK to have a business which 'just' supports its employees and users.\" A question about cultural preservation comes next, not relevant to this brief. Then a question about our inability to be totally locally reliant - i.e. you cannot make your phone yourself, you rely on a complex global supply chain. Rushkoff acknowledges this and replies: \"Hopefully, we'll get complex technological goods from a complex global economy, and food human goods from a local economy. Which means we'll need more than one kind of currency.\" Why does the currency matter so much? \"If you're using a bank-issued currency, then it has to be loaned into existence and requires payback. Also, if you're using a centrally-issued currency, than Walmart will have an advantage over local business. The only advantage local business is going to have over big global business - because money is more expensive for local businesses - is if the local business starts with local re-investments in itself [...] \"In all of these things, we're looking at a new balance between your hard drive and RAM. We've been in a hard drive society for a long, long time and it's all about storage. We're moving into RAM, as individuals too: much more present-based access to memory as opposed to just hoarding stuff [...] We can balance some of the ills of long distance economic activity with a few mechanisms to help local economic activity compete effectively. If we are in a free market economy, we should have free market currencies. \" Is kickstarter a viable alternative for people who don't want to get funded by corporate capital? Also, what about Bitcoin? \"Kickstarter is much more real-time: you're matching supply and demand instead of having a capitalist speculate on future value [As for Bitcoin], I'm not looking at a currency that you're trying to hoard; you're not investing in a currency, but rather using a currency merely to promote transactions so that you can get the stuff you want and do the stuff you want.\" How can we read the humanism Rushkoff is arguing for in the context of Bitcoin? What is the effect of humans interfacing with inanimate objects - does it lead to the presentism and present shock he's talking about? \"Present shock is our initial wobble at moving from a linear-time-based society to this digital, choice-based, highly interruptive society [...] Presentism is really the ability to embrace and survive and reclaim our humanity on this landscape. Any technology only helps us reclaim our humanity insofar as it helps us create time to be with other people . It's the face-to-face, real-time human interaction that matters. And the more you do that - and this starts to get out there - the less money even needs to be a part of the equation .\" Imagine we used open protocols for money to ensure that no-one ever needs money again? That would be a true redefinition of wealth. That would be a story worth writing home about. \"The monies we have now don't allow for that. They're not supposed to. They're part of a system through which we've been taught not to trust each other, not to transact. We've been taught that money is a cleaner way to engage. Hopefully, we'll start to trust each other more than the stuff.\" Of course, it might take multiple global crises to get people to this point, but living in hope remains - at the least - a better psychological attitude than living in despair. \"It's just a matter of creating balance between the sense of infinite connections and the sense of holism. It's the same challenge you find at any level: take groups and individuals. If you over-identify with the group, you lose yourself; if you over-identify with yourself, you lose community. It's just something we have to be conscious of now if we're going to remain coherent.\"","title":"Time"},{"location":"module-3/time/#the-present-time","text":"Let's take a deep breath and remember what reclaiming the web is all about: augmenting our ability to think freely for ourselves; creating time; and extending our ability to cooperate.

That would be a true redefinition of wealth. That would be a story worth writing home about. \"The monies we have now don't allow for that. They're not supposed to. They're part of a system through which we've been taught not to trust each other, not to transact. We've been taught that money is a cleaner way to engage. Hopefully, we'll start to trust each other more than the stuff.\" Of course, it might take multiple global crises to get people to this point, but living in hope remains - at the least - a better psychological attitude than living in despair. \"It's just a matter of creating balance between the sense of infinite connections and the sense of holism. It's the same challenge you find at any level: take groups and individuals. If you over-identify with the group, you lose yourself; if you over-identify with yourself, you lose community. It's just something we have to be conscious of now if we're going to remain coherent.\"","title":"Questions?"},{"location":"resources/","text":"Create and Connect with Better Tools When we began this course, this was just a single page with a few of the best tools we knew and used in our own practice.
